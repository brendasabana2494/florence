										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the novel coronavirus first started spreading like wildfire, people called it the “great leveller”. No respecter of status or economic background, Covid-19 affected people at all strata, from housemaids to Hollywood royalty; peons to prime ministers. Tom Hanks, Boris Johnson and an aide to US Vice President Mike Pence all contracted it.</p>
<p>Even more upsetting were the stories about how medical staff in England came out of retirement to fight in the hospital frontlines, only to succumb to the disease. It was a grim reminder that all humans are, at our core, similarly vulnerable.</p>
<p>At first, it was the healthcare fallout that was front of mind in the global consciousness. Then, Covid-panic led to a worldwide Covid-lockdown. No country was unscathed, few businesses, whether on the supply or the demand side, were unaffected. Here was the virus flexing its muscles – as the great economic leveller.</p>
<p>But is that really the case, or are some segments of society underwriting a larger chunk of the virus price tag?</p>
<h3>Is it in fact, the Great Accelerator?</h3>
<p>Lockdown sent people scurrying to work from their homes (WFH). This was when the dividing line started to show.</p>
<p>Laptop warriors, able to carry out their economically valuable activity anywhere with just Wi-Fi, were best equipped for WFH. Traders continued to profit from arbitrage without missing a beat, IT folks and other techies thrived in their cyber-environment, as have many professionals.</p>
<p>The same was largely true for my firm, TSMP Law Corporation. WFH was an inconvenience, but it did not take away our jobs. We have been keenly aware of digital disruption in the legal industry, having <a href="https://www.tsmplaw.com/forefront/coming-for-lawyers-soon-digital-disruption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned about it here in Forefront</a> three years ago. We pride ourselves on being cutting edge and our lawyers adapted remarkably well to WFH’s exigencies, as did Singapore’s legal sector generally. The courts and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre have segued relatively painlessly to virtual hearings. In fact, Singapore is poised to grab a larger share of the international dispute resolution market. After all, if hearings the world over must be conducted over video, why litigate in Cambodia, Thailand or Vietnam if you can have the seat of your dispute resolution in an international legal hub like Singapore? </p>
<p>But the pandemic has also exposed weaknesses. Internally, our productivity fell probably by 20 per cent – not for lack of legal work, but because our back-office functions, while computerised, still required too much human intervention. Lawyers had to undertake tasks usually done by support staff, who now could do much less from their homes. With WFH poised to be the new normal, at least for the next 12 to 18 months, our law corporation has had to implement back-end automation software. It is a migration that we would have done in three years, yanked forward due to urgent necessity. And while Government assistance is generous – up to 80 per cent of a S$400,000 first-year cost – subsequent yearly fees will see a big jump in the firm’s technology spend.</p>
<p>Technology will thus replace the work of lower skilled staff, yielding productivity savings of an estimated 35 per cent. That sounds great until you translate it into human terms: more than a third of these folks will be rendered redundant. A two-month circuit breaker is something everyone hunkers down to ride out; longer than that and companies have to make permanent structural changes. Forced to decamp from the office, technology becomes the new “rent” – the single most expensive line item in your monthly expenses. It is a cost that will be borne disproportionately by our receptionists, secretaries and other support staff, who must be upskilled or face being retrenched.</p>
<p>Ironically, the coronavirus has done what the government has been pushing for years – rev up tech adoption. Not just accelerating the rate of technological change, the pandemic is also speeding up the rich-poor divide. The lower-skilled, and hence lower-paid, employees are most affected by innovation’s march, and are seeing their lunches stolen by machines. Those least able to afford it bear the biggest brunt.</p>
<p>It is a thorny problem. While the Government’s substantial job support packages help companies keep workers on the payroll, these can only be temporary patches that buy time to retrain staff. Typically, the employees who most need to retool are above 50, for whom the old way of doing things is more than a means to earn a living, it is a security blanket. Technology is befuddling and threatening, and its rollout is often met with a passive resistance born of fear.  </p>
<h3>The bigger picture</h3>
<p>And no matter how large Singapore’s reserves, it cannot underwrite the livelihood of an entire generation of the workforce. In a crisis, the money must go to keeping otherwise healthy companies on temporary life support – to borrow a Covid analogy, by putting them on a ventilator until their lungs can work properly again. The aid cannot be used to keep bad businesses alive artificially, or our economy will be overrun with “zombie companies”. Such enterprises have no place in tomorrow’s economy. And because of Covid, “tomorrow” has been brought forward to today.</p>
<p>But a country is made up of its citizens. What is the point of having a thriving economy if we cannot look after all our people? The answer is not in more handouts; we need to make some seismic changes across all segments.</p>
<p>First, the government. It needs to take the courageous step of saying “no” to saving companies and jobs that have no place in the new economy. This will be unpopular and painful, all the more severe because there is no time to ease into the change. Older workers will be out of jobs; those leaving school will face an unwelcoming employment market. But the government must persevere in applying our reserves solely to help companies that are adopting innovations for long-term survival and workers who are willing to be re-trained and re-deployed, not simply retained.</p>
<p>Then, the corporates. Those in sectors that find it tough to attract Singaporeans must embrace technology and innovation to cut out back-breaking, menial work, and creating highly regarded, better remunerated roles. This will engage employees seeking value-added, complex tasks, in otherwise less-attractive industries. </p>
<p>Now, society. Singaporeans have to overcome our bias against certain jobs. We have a huge foreign worker population in Singapore because locals are loath to wait on tables, nurse the ill and plumb toilets – all of which are respectable jobs in the West. As a society, we need to recognise the importance of these jobs, and those who do them. Beating ourselves up over how we treat foreign workers should morph into a deeper appreciation of their role in building our nation. And if the pandemic has taught us nothing else, it should have seared the importance of healthcare work into our collective consciousness. These are not jobs to be looked down upon, certainly not when your old job no longer exists.</p>
<p>Extreme situations bring out the worst clichés: I have been told repeatedly that you should never let a good crisis go to waste. It is also said that this pandemic will be our generation’s defining event. Both are true, but the analogy that springs to mind is that childhood story of the frog in a pot. The amphibian does not know it is being boiled alive because the fire is being turned up gradually. Likewise, Singapore. If we do not reinvent ourselves, we may discover too late that this is no warm bath to be savoured. Coronavirus has turned up the heat drastically. Time to make the leap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans have allegedly outbid the French for masks “right on the tarmac” just as the goods were to be flown off to their destination. From Amazon to Rakuten to Carousell, traders exploited fears by price-gouging on masks and hand sanitisers. Meanwhile, panicked shoppers worldwide cleaned stores out of rice and toilet paper, leaving the vulnerable with no access to necessities.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 free-for-all calls to mind the theme of critically acclaimed Spanish movie <em>The Platform</em>, where each prisoner in a vertical prison receives food on a platform, accessible for only two minutes a day before the dumb waiter is lowered to the next level. In theory, no one would go hungry if everyone took only what they needed. In practice, those who got first dibs gorged on the smorgasbord, leaving others with nothing.</p>
<p>When the protagonist suggested a fairer way to distribute the food, his cellmate retorted: “Are you a communist?”</p>
<h3>Good old-fashioned capitalism</h3>
<p>Indeed, some have been tempted to conclude that authoritarianism trumps democracy because China’s crisis response appears better than America’s so far. That would be a mistake. After all, democracies such as Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand and Germany have been lauded as role models, and not Iran or North Korea.</p>
<p>Similarly, we do not quite have to turn to the planned economy to save lives and the economy. Good old-fashioned capitalism will accelerate the process of rewarding flexible, forward-thinking businesses that forge brave new paths.</p>
<p>This year’s Formula 1 season has been suspended. No surprise there, since the races mean tightly packed crowds and spectators flying internationally, activities verboten at this time. The twist was the replacement: virtual races by F1 drivers and celebrities, including former boy band One Direction member Liam Payne and YouTube gamers. The first, which took place on 22 March, garnered 3.2 million online views and 1.2 million television views, reflecting a desire for novel entertainment as a reprieve from the doom and gloom. While the virtual races may have only attracted a fraction of the audience of the traditional ones, which saw 1.9 billion television viewers last year, surely some revenue is better than none. And this new series may well form another profit centre catering to a new generation of motorsports fans post-pandemic.</p>
<p>Fujifilm Holdings is another prime example of a nimble company. Better known for its photography equipment and materials than its pharmaceuticals, it saw its shares rise by 15.4 per cent when its influenza medicine appeared to be effective against the coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 disease. Its photography business outlived its erstwhile competitor, Kodak, for an entire decade because it had pivoted decisively towards digital cameras. At the same time, it diversified aggressively, including its 2006 foray into pharmaceuticals. It was a smart decision, considering Japan’s ageing demographics, and appears even cleverer now in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3>A moral compass for the bottom line</h3>
<p>To survive this crisis and the next, businesses will also need to take greater care of their employees and the wider community, instead of fetishising returns at all costs. The American Business Roundtable, a non-profit whose members comprise major US-company CEOs, redefined the purpose of a corporation last August, from that of profit maximisation for shareholders to a commitment to take care of all stakeholders. Rather than rejecting capitalism, the realignment affirms the members’ belief that the “free-market system is the best means of generating good jobs, a strong and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy environment and economic opportunity for all”.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, one of the 181 supporting signatories, walks the talk. It donated one million surgical masks to Chinese healthcare workers and over 1,300 packs of contact lenses to Wuhan’s physicians and nurses to help them see under their mandatory protective goggles. After it announced that it would begin human testing of its coronavirus vaccine by September, its shares surged by nine per cent.</p>
<p>Would its share price perform the same without the do-goodery? Perhaps in the short term, as long as it makes progress towards the vaccine. But in the long term, it may not continue to be the world’s largest healthcare company if it did not provide a sense of purpose to its 130,000 employees.</p>
<p>To quote Richard Branson: “Take care of your employees, and they’ll take care of your business.” The Virgin boss is well-supported by data. Oxford University’s Said Business School concluded in a 2019 study that workers were 13 per cent more productive when happy. Harvard Business Review showed in 2018 that nine out of 10 employees, across all demographic classes and salary levels, were willing to sacrifice pay for greater meaning at work. The average American worker would forego 23 per cent of their entire future lifetime earnings if they had a job that is always meaningful. Such work also benefits their employers, translating into an additional annual output of US$9,078 per worker, as well as US$6.43 million savings in annual turnover-related costs for every 10,000 workers.</p>
<p>A moral compass is not a nice-to-have. A company’s toxic culture can be its downfall. Boeing’s share price nosedived after its 737 Max was grounded. Crash investigations revealed the rot, including an employee email that said the “airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys”. Ed Pierson, an erstwhile Boeing senior manager, said that employees were overworked and making mistakes. When employees are not looked after, businesses suffer and lives can be tragically lost.</p>
<h3>Circuit breaker</h3>
<p>Amid the hardship, businesses that have instead turned the tables around to give back to the community may well thrive. The world’s largest luxury group, LVMH, swapped production from sumptuous perfumes and cosmetics to hand sanitisers – to be distributed for free. CEOs across the globe, including that of hospitality giant Marriott, Arne Sorenson, took salary moratoriums in solidarity with suffering employees. Singapore Airlines worked with hospitals to redeploy grounded cabin crew as caregivers – meaningful community work for those who avail themselves to the opportunity.</p>
<p>These actions embody true leadership. According to a study by PR and management consultancy agency Edelman, 64 per cent of consumers choose, switch, avoid or boycott a brand based on its stand on societal issues. When the pandemic is over, consumers will fly Singapore Airlines to stay in Marriott hotels and shop for LV bags.</p>
<p>Clearly, not all social aims may be achieved by companies alone. Those goals ought to be discerned at the ballot box, and guided by laws passed by legislators accountable to the electorate. We see that in action now. Under pressure from regulators and to avoid reputational damage, online marketplaces have since removed thousands of exploitative listings, leaving at least one online merchant stuck with 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser. The Ministry of Trade and Industry in Singapore invoked the Price Control Act for only the third time in history, to clamp down on the price-gouging in Singapore.</p>
<p>As Singapore trudges through its two-month-long circuit breaker, in time we will see which businesses can rewrite their rule books so that they can emerge stronger, just as the laws have been rewritten to deal with this pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An impromptu foosball game with your neighbour while waiting for the laundry. Cooking classes in a communal Masterchef-inspired kitchen. Movie screenings, board game nights, and in-house yoga and meditation sessions. These are but some of the activities to look forward to if you take up quarters in a co-living facility.</p>
<p>In 2018, <em>Bloomberg</em> named such “adult dorms” as one of the eight telling social trends of the US economy. Their popularity has certainly grown in crowded cities such as London and New York over the past decade. UK-based startup The Collective launched last year what is said to be the world’s single largest co-living development – a 21 storey building with 705 rooms in London’s Canary Wharf. This is already set to be surpassed by an 803-unit compound currently being built in Silicon Valley by San Francisco-based startup Starcity.</p>
<p>In Singapore, co-living took off in a big way only in 2019. The Ascott Limited, CapitaLand’s wholly owned lodging business unit, opened in September its flagship lyf Funan Singapore, which is the largest co-living property in Southeast Asia. Another home-grown co-living operator with a similar impatience with vowels, Hmlet, successfully raised US$40 million (S$53.9 million) in a series B round last July, and announced in October a joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate Co to establish over 10,000 rooms in Japan over the next few years. Spilling over into 2020, Hong Kong-based Dash Living entered Singapore just last month through its acquisition of local start-up, Easycity.   </p>
<p>Co-living spaces continue to sprout in virtually every major city in the world, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<h3>What exactly is co-living?</h3>
<p>Co-living is most easily understood as the housing equivalent of co-working, where residents rent individual apartments, studios or rooms with access to an array of shared spaces and facilities. Similar to serviced apartments, such facilities typically charge a flat rental fee, covering the basics such as furnishings and utilities. However, in line with the shared aspect of co-living, residents at some properties are expected to pick up after themselves when using common facilities, and housekeeping is usually provided on a weekly rather than daily basis. Taking convenience and all costs into consideration, the rent works out to be competitive to that of a similarly sized room in a condominium in the same area.</p>
<p>It has been touted as both a solution to the problem of increasingly unaffordable home prices in developed cities, as well as a practical option for digital nomads who require the flexibility of seamless mobility across cities and countries.</p>
<p>A 2018 PropertyGuru survey found that 39 per cent of millennials (defined here as those between 21 and 37 years of age) still lived with their parents. Among these, two-thirds were looking to buy a home but 69 per cent said that they do not have a structured savings plan to finance such a purchase. Additionally, according to the Department of Statistics, fewer Singaporeans are getting married (and hence, do not require larger homes for raising families) and those who buck the trend, do so later in life.</p>
<p>Helping capture this demographic is the decidedly millennial slant in the recent developments and trends in co-living. Promotional materials are typified by promises of “insta‑worthy” spaces. lyf promotes itself as “a global community of thought leaders” and hosts regular networking sessions and other social activities for its residents, while Hmlet’s “members” are encouraged to “find your tribe” through organised events such as restaurant and bar takeovers.</p>
<h3>Co-living makes sense (and cents)</h3>
<p>Detractors may dismiss co-living as a passing fad or (more charitably) a niche option for a very specific demographic. However, stripping away the shiny social media-centred marketing, there are two drivers that could give co-living the legs to go the distance in Singapore’s crowded and competitive property market.</p>
<p>First, the movement is underpinned by a sense of community – far from a new or radical concept. Early examples can be found from Yuan Dynasty-hutongs (胡同) to the camps established by hunter-gatherers in the Middle Ages. Closer to home, the older generation would remember kampung living and the communal TV.</p>
<p>While technology now gives us the ability to maintain relationships across continents in real time, the fundamental human need for a sense of belonging will undoubtedly endure. This gives co-living traction and the potential to flourish.</p>
<p>Second, the property market is primed for an upheaval. In 2019, Singapore retained its position as the world’s second most expensive property market, and also found itself in the top‑10 costliest list for those looking to rent. This does not bode well for the state’s drive to be a hub of all things, in terms of attracting foreign talent as well as avoiding a brain drain.</p>
<p>Co-living fills a conspicuous gap within the continuum of home ownership, traditional rentals, and serviced apartments and hotels. Its attractiveness lies in its flexibility, with short three-month minimum commitments (the statutory requirement) in most cases, the option of rolling monthly extensions, doing away with year-long tenancy contracts, and the payment of sometimes hefty security deposits.</p>
<p>On the supply side, different business models are available, each with its own benefits and risks.</p>
<p>According to a JLL-led study carried out last year, most co-living operators choose to adopt an asset-light approach of leasing entire properties and retrofitting them for use as co-living spaces. While this approach allows operators to acquire expand and scale up relatively quickly, retrofitting expenses and fixed operating costs can be hefty, and a <em>Business Times</em> article highlighted the risk that such operators are looking to recover their investments by tapping on revenue from a client base that is, practically by definition, transient and mobile.</p>
<p>The same <em>Business Times</em> article noted that an alternative model is for operators to enter into revenue-sharing models with landlords, where a proportion of turnover is paid instead of fixed rent – this hedges the risk for the operator but at the same time introduces uncertainty to the landlord’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Further options include fully owner-operated developments like lyf Funan Singapore. In exchange for complete control, such a model requires the owner’s significant level of commitment and investment, especially in the case of a development designed and built from ground up for specific use as a co-living facility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the viability of co-living, as with any business model, will depend largely on the operators’ ability to maximise efficiency and revenues, while at the same time managing their risks and making strategic and well-considered investment decisions.</p>
<h3>The future of co-living</h3>
<p>In spite of the strides made in the co-living space in Singapore thus far, these are still early days yet. Even including facilities currently under construction, co-living spaces account for less than 1 per cent of the total private housing stock in Singapore.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given its apparently high demand – the <em>Business Times</em> article referenced earlier reported that occupancy rates hovered around the 90 to 95 per cent mark – co-living certainly has the potential to grow in terms of recognition as an asset class and establish itself as a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>It might well be that success will ultimately lie in the efforts by developers and operators to embrace and develop the sense of community and belonging by occupants of co-living spaces, instead of viewing them as short-term lodgers who can be charged as much as possible for the smallest liveable space.</p>
<p>In that light, perhaps the real challenge is in changing perceptions of co-living as a millennial fad, such that it gains acceptance as a real, viable option for just about anyone in search for a temporary (or even semi-permanent) abode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2019 has been a rollercoaster ride: Trump accelerates and then suddenly slams on the brakes on his tit-for-tat trade war with China. Hong Kong, hitherto the paradigm of pragmatism, lies smouldering as months of pro-democracy protests see no end. A Swedish girl (celebrating her 17th birthday just last Friday) becomes the unlikely face of environmentalism, shaming Boomers for doing nothing about climate change in front of the UN. The Nobel Prize eludes her but she bags <em>Time Magazine’s</em> Person of the Year instead. Defying odds, Boris Johnson scores a landslide win in the snap elections, possibly paving way to a Brexit that has eluded Britain for months and months.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the real estate market remains languid despite talk of capital flight from the Fragrant to safer harbours, PMDs are all but banned in a flurry of regulations, the Monica Baey sexual misconduct incident sets off a series of Me Too awakenings, POFMA passes into law (goodbye fake news sites?), and the AHTC trial makes a hitherto legalistic term “fiduciary” a household term.</p>
<p>Moving forward into a brave new 2020, in the last Forefront article, our head of IP &amp; TMT Adrian Tan has already predicted that China will issue its own state-backed cryptocurrency in its bid for tighter domestic control and wider world domination.</p>
<p>Here are what the other partners think will happen this year – some predictions being more far-out than others. But if there is anything that the extreme developments of the previous few years have shown, it is that the world has become an increasingly volatile place.</p>
<h3>Thio Shen Yi, SC (Dispute resolution)</h3>
<p>The exuberant march of madness of governments continues. The Representatives impeach Trump and a circus trial follows in the Senate, but not enough Republicans cross the floor to impeach him there as well. Trump therefore hangs onto the Presidency, manages not to start any wars, cold or otherwise, raises more campaign funds than anyone else, and gallops away to win a second term. Chaos ensues, but all the Democrats could do is to contemplate their navels. Four more years of the reality TV presidency. In the UK, Boris forms a government and makes a hard-ish Brexit happen with a border on the Irish Sea. The Scots call a referendum on independence and both sides of the Irish border start talking about invoking the Good Friday Agreement and also calling a referendum for a united Ireland. More chaos, and Boris responds strongly by calling the cries for referendums as “codswallop”. Only 10 per cent of the country understand him.</p>
<h3>Stefanie Yuen Thio (Corporate)</h3>
<p>Hong Kong’s troubles achieve no definitive resolution. No Chinese tanks roll in from Shenzhen, and certainly no concessions will be forthcoming from Beijing. But the windfall that some have predicted for Singapore doesn’t materialise. Rich Chinese will use the perceived opportunity to get the Singapore government to allow them more residential land buying rights, and dangle the carrot of increased investment to try to secure permanent residency. But aside from them parking more funds here, leading to fully sold high end condos that are only one quarter lived in, we will not see an exodus of economic activity from Hong Kong or the Mainland.</p>

<p>The ability of governments to implement policy, no matter how rational, is increasingly being held hostage by mob rule, challenging the rule of law and even democracy, as manifest in the continued unrest from Lebanon and Chile to Catalonia and Hong Kong, as well as civil disobedience across Western countries. The mainstream media continues to adopt an indulgent attitude towards these events, helping shape public opinion that protests, no matter how unreasonable or violent, are an acceptable alternative to the ballot box.</p>

<p>The AI art market will become more established. In 2018, the first AI artwork sold at Christie’s, a portrait of a fictional aristocrat, fetched US$432,500 (S$584,000). This year, cold water was poured on the budding AI art market when Sotheby sold its first AI artwork, a digital show of portraits constantly being generated, for a fraction at US$52,634. However, as AI art moves away from copying human artwork (and portraiture), and starts a new art movement, AI art will become more commercially valuable for reasons other than novelty. The tough legal questions as regards intellectual property of such work may then be tested.</p>
<h3>Ian Lim (Employment &amp; Labour)</h3>
<p>Parliament will consider more comprehensive protection for whistle-blowers in 2020. Singaporeans are already gradually becoming more “woke” about speaking out responsibly to right wrongs, and this development will help Singaporean corporates be better governed and prevent corruption and harassment. Legislation will now need to gather the piecemeal protection presently scattered across various statutes to better protect genuine whistle-blowers from speaking out without fear of reprisal.</p>
<h3>Kelvin Koh (Trusts and Land Disputes)</h3>
<p>The battlefield for tech supremacy shifts to 5G. Facetime fossilises and 3D live-streaming is the new norm. With improved VR systems, we will see a fading gap between face-to-face meetings and virtual 3D engagements. As lawyers embrace the new legal tech, courtroom dramas start to play out in online court rooms with live 3D visuals of the judge and witnesses. Countries vying to be the top arbitration venue will face challenges from servers competing to host the next online arbitration. Singapore will have to rely more on chilli crabs and <em>bak kut teh</em> to draw disputants to resolve disputes physically here instead of logging on to new online arbitration forums. </p>
<h3>Jennifer Chia (Banking &amp; Finance; Corporate Real Estate)</h3>
<p>Everyone expects a real estate supply glut, but here’s a far-out (but far more interesting) prediction: the Singapore government, as part of its election campaign, lowers or abolishes ABSD rates and Trump truly bromances Xi after their trade deal, leading to an uptick to the Singapore property market in 2020. Boomtown Charlie!</p>
<h3>June Ho (Corporate)</h3>
<p>The Council for Board Diversity will gain momentum in connecting stakeholders in order to reach the target for 20 per cent females on all boards in 2020, marking a milestone for female empowerment. More women will be inspired to venture into the boardroom, knowing that they are not just ticking a box. Companies will seek worthy candidates from beyond the usual industries or sectors. Local investors may follow AustraliaSuper’s footsteps, halting investments in companies that lack female board representation. Engagement and support from men lead to increased diversity and inclusion, starting a virtuous cycle, empowering women at all levels at the workplace.</p>

<p>Looking to the skies, the promise of autonomous passenger-carrying drones will remain a blip on the horizon due to prohibitive implementation costs and unresolved safety concerns. But logistics companies may dabble in the technology.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest developments in global finance has recently occurred, but not enough people are talking about it. It features technology, money and a battle between global superpowers. China has made an abrupt U-turn on digital currency and, if I read the tea leaves correctly, will soon issue a new kind of money that we all must use if we wish to continue dealing with the world’s second largest economy. In so doing, we have to allow the Middle Kingdom to track what we buy, sell and invest in.</p>
<p>Now, the Chinese have a long history of being innovative with money. When the human race first started trading, they simply bartered stuff: I will swap my ass for your abacus and a bowl of your wanton dumplings.</p>
<p>Then, the Chinese introduced metal coins to the ancient world. A thousand years later, China introduced paper money to Europe. Soon, we will come to the third big Chinese financial innovation: digital money. I believe that China will be the world’s first country to issue a state-backed digital currency. And that will set the stage for world domination.</p>
<h3>Why digital money is different</h3>
<p>Existing currencies can be used for electronic payments, but they exist in physical form. Digital money exists only in electronic form. The most famous and widely used example is Bitcoin. Another is Libra, which a group of companies led by Facebook announced in June.</p>
<p>Digital money is great because one can move vast amounts of it easily and instantly, and it is harder to steal. But the best thing (for governments) is that it can be used to keep a permanent, public ledger of every transaction using a network of computers through blockchain technology, whereas transactions in existing currencies (also called “fiat currencies”) are largely anonymous.</p>
<p>The digital money that has been in the news is cryptocurrency. You get it by “mining”: when people use powerful computers to keep the blockchain working, they are rewarded by being given cryptocurrency in exchange.</p>
<p>Now, crypto-mining has a lot of potential in China. Profitable mining needs three things: cheap energy, a smart workforce and a stable technological infrastructure. China has the trifecta.</p>
<p>China is so good at mining cryptocurrency that two Chinese cryptocurrency mining giants, Bitmain and Canaan Creative, have separately filed for IPOs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission late this year.</p>
<h3>China’s big U-turn</h3>
<p>But only half a year ago, in April 2019, Beijing signalled that it planned to discourage crypto-mining by provisionally listing it as an industry to be eliminated. Observers assumed that China, like the US and the rest of the world’s governments, saw cryptocurrency as a threat to national sovereignty and was taking steps to discourage it.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, in October, Beijing quietly reversed its position, removing crypto-mining from the list. That low-key move coincided with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s high-key public statements supporting blockchain technology, just weeks ago.</p>
<p>Around that time, netizens in China began noticing something else. Posts criticising blockchain, or claiming it to be a scam, were being removed. A big policy shift was in the air.</p>
<p>Then, recently, Xinhua News Agency published a pro-Bitcoin article, giving detailed and objective coverage of cryptocurrency. That news agency is the biggest media organisation in China (and perhaps the world) and is the highest-ranking state media organ in the country alongside the People’s Daily. You can bet your little red book that the article and attitude were endorsed at the highest levels of Chinese government.</p>
<p>This gigantic U-turn could mean that China is on the verge of releasing its own digital money. If so, China would be the first nation in the world to do so.</p>
<p>What would this new Chinese digital currency look like? Based on President Xi’s public statements, I’m predicting that it would be a kind of state-controlled digital currency that uses blockchain. You could call it a crypto-communist cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3>Digital money with Chinese characteristics</h3>
<p>This may become the new face of the renminbi, which I call the Renminbitcoin, or RM฿ for short.</p>
<p>Will the RM฿ be just another cryptocurrency, with Chinese characteristics, with limited usage? Or will it cause a hundred flowers to bloom for the Chinese economy?</p>
<p>Let us look at the obvious benefits to introducing a state-backed digital currency.</p>
<p>It will help China track how its citizens and corporations are spending and investing, giving the Chinese authorities a wealth of information about its economy.</p>
<p>It also strengthens state control. China has introduced many ways to nudge its people in its desired direction. For example, its social credit system is designed to separate the nice from the naughty. Marry that to a digital currency and you can punish bad guys by literally withholding their pocket money.</p>
<p>But all that is nickel-and-dime stuff compared to this: world domination.</p>
<p>Want to buy goods made in China, enjoy infrastructure investments through its Belt and Road Initiative or obtain its foreign aid or loans? Transact in RM฿ or the deal is off.</p>
<p>Hence, it is quite possible that we are witnessing a historic event: China is readying a global currency to rival – and replace – the US dollar. It may be the fruition of China’s dream to create a digital currency that countries will use, not just to trade with China, but with each other.</p>
<p>So far, the US has used its economic power to implement policy far beyond its shores, because many other countries have the US dollar as their main foreign reserve currency. Oil and many other commodities are also quoted in US dollars.</p>
<p>This makes it easy for the US to control many things in the world, simply because it controls the US dollar. The US can impose sanctions, and target individuals, companies and countries, simply by outlawing the flow of its currency to those entities. Americans have weaponised their own currency.</p>
<p>China wants some of that power. Its dream could be for oil, gold, securities, basically anything to be quoted in RM฿ as the default currency. If that were to happen, then most transactions would be visible to, and maybe even controlled by, China. It too could use its RM฿ to effect sanctions on individuals, corporates and even nations, leading to Beijing and Washington competing on a more equal footing.</p>
<p>But if China requires those who buy stuff on Alibaba, for instance, to use the RM฿, the US could react by passing laws and regulations to restrict the use of RM฿ by its citizens and companies. And banks and financial institutions that have anything to do with the US would be caught in the middle. A new front will open in the trade war.</p>
<p>What should the rest of us, who do not live in China or the US, do?</p>
<h3>Coming to grips with digital money </h3>
<p>Governments around the world have to stop vilifying cryptocurrency. Maybe they ought to take the cue from Singapore. Earlier this year, its authorities waived sales tax on digital payment tokens. And just recently, the MAS signalled an intention to regulate the trading of cryptocurrency futures.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to the attitude of other regulators. For example, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission said earlier this month that exchanges allowing trading of bitcoin futures “may well be conducting an illegal activity”.</p>
<p>Singapore’s central bank is taking a bold step, but a necessary one. If China intends to issue RM฿, then it will happen. It would not be a long march at all, rather, it will be a great leap forward. As consumers and trading partners, we have to be ready to transact in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>We also have to realise that, if and when we start to use the RM฿, transactions will be logged into a server in Beijing and monitored by 大哥 (Big Brother). Money becomes data. If other governments follow suit and issue their own digital money, then that will enable them to monitor transactions done in that digital currency.</p>
<p>Welcome, then, to the third great Chinese financial innovation. As with metal money, and paper money, which China introduced and the rest of the world adopted, China’s new digital money will be the way of the future. Massive changes in the way we transact are afoot – you can bank on that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will remember 2019 as the year when many unicorns were exposed as donkeys in disguise.</p>
<p>Invoking the rarity and mystique of the mythical creature, a “unicorn” is the term the financial market coined for companies worth US$1 billion or more. The year opened with high hopes for such companies that sought an initial public offering (IPO) in the following months. And while some have done well – video-conferencing company Zoom has almost doubled its initial offer price while plant-based food producer Beyond Meat is trading at more than four times its value at listing – the market has not been kind to the most high-profile unicorns.</p>
<p>Take Uber. In the fictitious animal kingdom, the ride hailing, cab industry-destroying app was the ultimate unicorn. Its disruptive business model had taxi drivers striking to protest. So far-reaching was its impact that the company name has become a verb: commuters would just “uber” there; even lawyers are not spared, being threatened by the “uberisation” of their industry.</p>
<p>But Uber’s IPO this year received a lukewarm response. Its share price has tanked by 37 per cent. Lyft, its closest competitor, also listed earlier in the year and has suffered a near-40 per cent fall off in its trading price.</p>
<p>Another market disruptor, this time in the office leasing space, was even worse hit. WeWork, arguably the originator of the hip co-working space concept, had to cancel its planned October listing due to poor market demand for its shares. Its IPO was mired in allegations of corporate governance breaches and poor financial management. Its major shareholder, the world’s largest tech investor SoftBank, has taken a US$4.6 billion (S$6.3 billion) hit from the investment. WeWork is now expected to lay off thousands of employees and is facing a probe by the New York State Attorney-General.</p>
<p>From magical beasts, many unicorns now look like dressed-up donkeys. What has gone wrong?</p>
<h3>Not every disruptor is a unicorn</h3>
<p>First, not all startups are created equal. And not all are kings of disruption.</p>
<p>Since the early triumphs of Amazon and Apple, and the more recent phenomenal financial performance of Facebook, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet), the market has been on the hunt for the next FAANG success story, using the acronym that comprises the quintet’s initial letters. Because of the exponential growth of these companies, investment banks and venture capital investors who have put money into disruptive startups have a big incentive to identify the next one and bring it to IPO. A US$1 billion valuation automatically places the company in the stellar league, giving it an outsized chance of success.</p>
<p>Disruptive startups are not valued on traditional models of profits, but on their growth and development potential. Basically, they are as good as their trajectory, which is measured in revenue, clicks and customers. In some cases, valuation is based on GMV, the gross merchandise value of all sales made on the platform, which is much higher than the revenue that the platform would earn from those sales. It is a business model that needs to burn a lot of cash to offer customers incentives, effectively buying business revenue.</p>
<p>But doubt has been cast on their valuations at IPO.</p>
<p>In a research paper, Stanford School of Business Professor Ilya Strebulaev states that the reported valuations of unicorns are on average 51 per cent above their true worth, and that one in 10 unicorns is overvalued by at least 100 per cent.</p>
<p>Unicorns raise multiple rounds of funding before IPO, with successive fundraisings valuing the company at higher amounts. To attract these rising valuations – and blue-chip investors whose association with the company is its own advertisement – companies provide later investors with sweeteners. These range from preferential rights in exit events and veto rights, to guaranteed returns at IPO. For example, an investor may be promised more shares issued for free if the company’s valuation at IPO does not meet a minimum return threshold.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that the average unicorn has eight classes of shares, a complex share structure that makes it hard to determine a company’s worth at IPO. The market uses a rough-and-ready method: it multiplies the last fundraising price by all the company’s issued shares. But the differing rights mean that each class should, theoretically, be valued differently. Professor Strebulaev states that the market’s method is an “inappropriate valuation model” that significantly overvalues these corporates.</p>
<h3>Not every startup is a disruptor</h3>
<p>And then there is the problem of the business model.</p>
<p>The FAANG companies were legitimate disruptors.</p>
<p>Facebook changed the way the world relates and communicates, but has used the platform to make money from a traditional business model – advertising. Amazon, the “first mover” in online shopping, has for years ploughed its revenue back into building a phenomenal network and now dominates the space. Apple put a miniature media machine in our hands, selling us something we didn’t know we wanted, which we can no longer imagine life without. Netflix killed the DVD store, forever changing the way we consume video content. Google, well, I don’t have to tell you about the search engine. You can google it.</p>
<p>But not every startup is a disruptive force of nature, no matter their corporate taglines. WeWork talked a good game, stating in its IPO filing that its mission was “to elevate the world’s consciousness”. At its core, WeWork was a hipster landlord selling a lifestyle to millennials but faced the same challenges of other landlords – matching supply and demand for commercial office space. Peloton, which IPO’d in October, was similarly ostentatious in its ambition to “sell happiness”. Instead, the company sells exercise equipment. It touted itself as a media company simply because it streams fitness classes to touchscreens on its treadmills and stationary bicycles. Seeing through the hype, the market punished the company with a share price drop of 11 per cent on the first day of trading.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft’s poor showing post-IPO also reflect the challenges their business model faces. Ride-hailing apps have had to pay heavy subsidies to buy customer business, resulting in huge cash burn. In addition, they do not have high barriers to entry or customer stickiness. They also contend with intense competition to attract drivers.</p>
<h3>Unicorns need to forge a path to profit</h3>
<p>The market appears to be demanding what all investors ultimately require: profits. Of this year’s IPOs that have performed well, Zoom and Beyond Meat have both turned a profit. Notably, both WeWork and Peloton are loss-making. Uber, in its IPO filing, stated that it “may not achieve profitability” ever, based on its current business. This may have contributed to the drubbing in its trading price.</p>
<p>The success of the FAANG companies has shown that true disruptors which have sound business models and can give investors what they want – even if this takes a long time – will be rewarded. But the market needs to discern between unicorns and asses. Using a ride hailing app while it is in its cash burn phase may be a surer way to make money than investing in the stock of a company with no clear pathway to profitability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a headline-hogging speech at the UN last month, 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg berated politicians and business people for doing too little to arrest climate change, ruining the globe for future generations.</p>
<p>High-profile scandals back up her claim. Last week, an organisation representing 470,000 German drivers started a closely watched, landmark lawsuit against the Volkswagen Group. The auto giant was implicated in an emissions-test cheating saga, admitting that it had installed “defeat devices” in millions of cars to pass stringent exams. To date, “Dieselgate” has already cost Volkswagen more than US$30 billion (S$41.6 billion) globally in penalties, compensation and costs.</p>
<p>In its 2014 sustainability report – published shortly before the fraud was exposed – the carmaker hammered home its “long tradition of resolute commitment to environmental protection”, repeating the word “environment” <em>ad nauseam</em>, 335 times over 156 pages. At that time, Volkswagen was a leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).</p>
<p>The cheat is allegedly the result of a concerted, company-wide (and possibly industry-wide) effort. Investors should then ask whether they can still trust sustainability reports which, by and large, are a collection of data self-curated with little regulatory oversight.</p>
<h3>What is sustainability?</h3>
<p>Sustainability refers to “ESG” –­­­ environmental, social and governance factors. The concept casts a wide definitional net, encompassing green building and environmental consciousness, community and charity work, and fair employment practices and management succession planning. Corporates are mandated to look beyond immediate profit-making and prioritise environmental considerations, social responsibility and corporate governance.</p>
<h3>The case of the missing fish</h3>
<p>Sustainability is, of course, important. Take Japan’s moribund herring industry. Until the 1950s, much of Hokkaido’s western coast was built upon this small silvery fish. As stocks slowly depleted, fishermen moved north. The last haul was less than a tenth of its peak and the following year there were no herring at all, never to return.</p>
<p>Thousands of jobs were lost in what was perhaps the first example of an entire industry collapsing due to overfishing. But probably not the last: in an uncanny 21st century re-enactment, catches of pacific saury had fallen by two-thirds in 2019. Japan’s answer? Start the regulated fishing season earlier next year.</p>
<p>It should not take a Swedish child activist getting to New York City in a boat, using a bucket as a toilet during the said crossing, to point out that the world must embrace sustainability, and not just as a “good-to-have”.</p>
<h3>What is sustainability reporting?</h3>
<p>Government regulators have taken heed. SGX-listed companies are now required to prepare annual sustainability reports, explaining how they have been fulfilling their ESG goals. Over 20 global bourses, including the London Stock Exchange (but not the New York Stock Exchange), have made such reporting mandatory. Sustainability reporting indexes have been established to provide frameworks to benchmark such reporting efforts, including the DJSI, the SGX Sustainability Index, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the International Integrated Reporting Council.</p>
<p>Sustainability reports are, in turn, relied upon by impact-conscious investors to determine if they should invest in such companies.</p>
<p>It is progress, at least in theory. But as currently practised today, sustainability reporting is not an effective and accurate way to assess investment targets.</p>
<h3>The trouble with sustainability reporting</h3>
<p>First, the ESG factors – which range from environmental impact (itself a very broad topic), CSR concerns, employment practices and business ethics, to management policies and succession planning – are too wide-ranging to make any comparison of potential investments meaningful.</p>
<p>Second, there is the long tail. Sustainability as an issue should be of importance to every living person, but whether a corporate adopts sustainable business practices may not have relevance to a short-term investor.</p>
<p>Next, the lack of standardised sustainability reporting guidelines and independent verification make these reports unreliable (as our Volkswagen spoiler revealed). Corporates have leeway to make self-promoting statements or, more likely, to cut and paste the reports of other companies just to comply with the reporting requirement.</p>
<p>Companies could, and often do, choose to puff up their strengths. Case in point, British Petroleum, which caused the worst oil spill in US history. Investigations into Deepwater Horizon uncovered cut corners, despite British Petroleum’s sustainability report claiming robust health and safety controls.</p>
<p>Finally, companies tend to over-report, inundating investors in reams of data and making it hard to pinpoint the most material risks. This is an issue made amusingly manifest by the fact that it affects even the people tasked to put the information together: for example, power group ABB overstated its sulphur emissions by a factor of 1,000 by mistaking kilotonnes for tonnes, three years in a row, before anyone noticed.</p>
<p>More nefariously though, in over-reporting, companies may also be simultaneously “under-reporting” by burying information on poor corporate behaviour, or worse, leaving it out completely. For instance, some fail to disclose data from individual countries or subsidiaries simply to make their sustainability reporting look better – which is tolerated in sustainability reporting, but will not meet financial reporting standards.</p>
<p>As such, we still have some way to go in producing objective reports that investors can rely on. In our current framework, sustainability reporting can be an expensive box-ticking exercise or a cynical public relations move, with companies picking the benchmark that best suits their interests.</p>
<h3>The way forward</h3>
<p>In order for sustainability reporting to make any sense, we need to do two things.</p>
<p>First, sustainability metrics need to be harmonised to a globalised standard.</p>
<p>We could advocate for a specific framework, with room for industry-specific adjustments. For instance, we could look at the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), which has recently published a revised sustainability reporting guidance based on GRI for its member exchanges with the aim of standardising ESG reporting.</p>
<p>Second, sustainability issues should not be lumped together as one concept, as it only diffuses the impact of those factors on the investor’s decisions.</p>
<p>Governance is the common denominator for all companies. As such, of the three factors, it should be the cornerstone and needs more robust reporting and policing metrics.</p>
<p>From a purely financial investment perspective, environmental and social factors have a less immediate and direct impact on the investor, who may not attach as much significance to them. In addition, depending on the industry the company is operating in, the weightage to be assigned to such factors ought to differ.</p>
<p>For example, businesses such as mining companies and palm oil manufacturers, which are reliant on natural resources, tend to contribute more to pollution by their very nature. Companies with disruptive business models that are heavily reliant on a highly motivated workforce may need to institute better employment initiatives and community engagement programmes to attract and retain talent. Investors will be interested in how these corporates are handling environmental and social concerns respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a company is in an industry where its sustainability efforts have a direct impact on investment, it will, as a good business practice, naturally publish an update on this, absent of a listing rule. So goes the question: why not let market forces decide?</p>
<p>Perhaps the issue here is too large for the free market to handle. Governments need to take the lead. In a promising move, in his 2019 National Day Rally Speech Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stressed the “grave” challenge of climate change and the extensive efforts the nation needs to put in as a whole in order to ensure its survival. Concerted – and sustained – government action will pave the way for corporates to seek excellence, not just in sustainability reporting, but in achieving ESG goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong, now entering its 15<sup>th</sup> week of protests, has been filled with increasingly incendiary rhetoric and escalating violence. This past weekend saw protesters lighting fires at an MTR station entrance, just outside the uber-luxe Bulgari boutique in Central. This, notwithstanding that Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, had announced the withdrawal of the extradition bill over which the protests had originated.</p>
<p>Unlike the relatively peaceful Occupy Central movement in 2014, which was largely student-led, these demonstrations have run the gamut of peaceful lunch-time gatherings to violent clashes with law enforcement, involving people from different age and socio-economic groups, including professionals. The protests have led to airport disruptions, reports of capital flight from the Fragrant Harbour, and a tumbling stock market. Their ferocity and protractedness have been shocking for a city famed for its business-minded outlook.</p>
<p>Singapore, which has long enjoyed a friendly but keen rivalry with Hong Kong, is watching the situation closely. After all, the two cities have so much in common that it begs the question: if this can happen in pragmatic Hong Kong, do we also have a tipping point?</p>
<p>First, the similarities. Both Hong Kong and Singapore have postage stamp-sized geographies with few natural resources. Each territory boasts a world-class financial and services centre. On limited land each hosts a large expatriate and immigrant population because economic dependence on the finance and services sectors requires a steady stream of foreign labour. Hong Kong’s 7.4 million residents occupy 1,110 sq km (about 6,700 people per sq km), while Singapore’s estimated 5.6 million population lives in 724 sq km (or 7,800 people per sq km). Like us, Hong Kong’s residents also complain that the crowds have put an unbearable strain on transportation and other public services. The most heartfelt and vociferous grouse, though, is that the steep rise in property values is putting home ownership out of the reach of many locals.</p>
<p>At a more visceral level, the two territories understand what it is to fight for survival. Both economies were battered during the 2003 SARS outbreak when scared residents stayed home, international arrivals dried up and businesses ground to a halt. But Singapore and Hong Kong recovered and bounced back stronger. Hong Kong businesses, in particular, exhibited deep commercial pragmatism: in the post-SARS world, sales assistants and waitstaff have become far more service-oriented.  </p>
<p>But here is where the two cities diverge.</p>
<p>Residential property prices in Singapore may be high but they cannot hold a candle to Hong Kong’s, where the world’s most expensive housing is to be found, according to CBRE. The average price of a home there is S$1.72 million, whereas our mean property price is 30 per cent lower at S$1.22 million.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are partly historical. Large tracts of Hong Kong real estate – and therefore land prices – are controlled by a handful of Hong Kong tycoons, a leftover of British rule. This has eroded the power of Hong Kong’s government. The difference between private and public holdings is marked in the Fragrant Harbour. Step from any glittering skyscraper owned by a property mogul and onto the government-maintained sidewalk in the swanky Central district, and you will be startled at the stark juxtaposition of gloss and grime. It is a contrast you do not see in Singapore. More importantly, more Singaporeans are able to afford homes. 79 per cent of our population own their Housing Development Board flats; in Hong Kong, only 16 per cent own their subsidised sale flats. Magnifying this effect is the average monthly wage: Hong Kong’s stands at approximately S$3,000, significantly lower than Singapore’s estimated S$5,000.</p>
<p>Singapore is also an independent state with a democratically elected government. Hong Kong, as part of China, does not enjoy the same system of universal suffrage. This was what sparked the Occupy Central movement five years ago.</p>
<p>The proposed extradition bill, if passed, would have allowed Hong Kong to detain and extradite persons to territories with whom it does not have treaties that facilitate this. This was seen by protesters as an extension of Mainland China’s control of the semi-autonomous region, and a weakening of the “one country, two systems” guarantee.  </p>
<p>Concern at this perceived overreach has been fomenting for some time. In 2017, it was reported that a Chinese billionaire had been abducted from the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong and taken to the Mainland. This came after the abduction, two years previously, of five Hong Kong booksellers who had published works criticising Chinese leaders. The bill would have legitimised extraditions from Hong Kong to, among other territories, China.</p>
<p>These differences draw a bright line between Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Lest we think that our circumstances are so far removed from Hong Kong’s that similar unrest could not happen, it is worth noting one key difference between us and Hong Kong. The latter’s population is largely racially homogenous – 93 per cent are ethnic Chinese. Our society is multi-racial. While diversity has long been a strength, it is also a factor that could quickly provoke unhappiness, as the recent furore over “Brownface” – to some, a misconceived advertisement; to others, a racially insensitive one – has demonstrated. The highly emotive response to the advertisement and the government’s proactive efforts to defuse the situation clearly illustrate the potential for racial tensions to divide the country.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Singapore are both financial centres of international influence. Both punch far above their paltry weight class. The similarities mean that we compete on everything from university rankings to personal tax rates. We race to secure better, and more, IPOs and strive to prove that we are more business-friendly than the other.</p>
<p>But Singapore and Singaporeans have greater power of self-determination. We may chafe at certain government policies, but these come from a government voted in by the people. And we may complain about land prices, but the majority of us live in homes we own. Still, there is no room in this little red dot for complacency. While we hope and pray that the unrest in Hong Kong will die down peacefully and soon, we should also take heed that peace and security cannot be taken for granted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rodrigo Duterte, the Filipino president, would like to change his country’s moniker “because the Philippines is named after King Phillip”. He appears to be eager to distance his nation from its colonial past, the said monarch being a 16<sup>th</sup> century ruler of Spain.</p>
<p>President Duterte may have been taking a leaf out of the private sector’s books.</p>
<p>Companies rebrand from time to time. It may be as minor as a shift in messaging, or as significant as a revamped logo or even a new trading name. And the reasons for doing so are myriad.</p>
<h3>Why rebrand?</h3>
<p>A brief study of the company famous for its Macintosh computers and iPhone handsets yields a couple of illuminating examples.</p>
<p>Since 1977, Apple Computer, Inc. marked every product that left its factory with an iconic logo: the namesake fruit with a bite taken out. In 1998, it eschewed the trademark’s multi-coloured stripes for a modern translucent and monochrome treatment. In 2007, it dropped the word “Computer”, to be henceforth known succinctly as “Apple, Inc.”.</p>
<p>Both were subtle changes that quietly underscored what were, in fact, seismic changes within the company.</p>
<p>The first was undertaken during the pivotal years after co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the helm, having been ousted earlier in a boardroom coup. He tore up Apple’s bloated and confusing catalogue. This consisted of everything but the kitchen sink, from printers and scanners to an unwieldy computer range, whose model numbers sometimes differed only to reflect the various channels in which the machines were sold.</p>
<p>He put in its place a streamlined strategy. Gone were the low-margin peripherals; what remained were two core products: the candy-coloured iMac for consumers and a subdued graphite-hued Power Mac for professionals and creatives. The move to instil product line discipline, together with the subsequent introduction of innovative products such as the iPod and the iPhone, was widely credited for saving Apple from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The second reflected Apple’s new line of consumer electronics. Established in a Silicon Valley garage, for its initial three decades the company was primarily a manufacturer of desktops and laptops. By 2007, though, its emphasis had shifted. Of the four main products – Mac, iPod, Apple TV and iPhone – only one was a computer.</p>
<p>On the back of the runaway success of the iPhone, at its peak last year Apple was a trillion-dollar company. Its brand alone, Forbes reckons, is now worth US$205.5 billion (S$290 billion) – marking the first time any firm had topped US$200 billion.</p>
<h3>The cost of rebranding</h3>
<p>Besides product strategy shifts or new business lines, companies sometimes rebrand due to a merger, as Bell Atlantic and GTE did when they combined, creating a new entity, Verizon. At other times, as in Duterte’s case, a rebranding helps companies distance themselves from someone or something undesirable. That was the case when the Lance Armstrong Foundation changed its name to Livestrong Foundation, disassociating itself from the disgraced cycling champ, who was embroiled in a doping scandal.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive, these can be expensive exercises. Holiday Inn’s 2007 rebranding, one of the biggest in corporate history, cost its parent group Intercontinental and franchisees US$1 billion, much of the money going into updated signage, better bedding and an improved customer experience.</p>
<p>Even with such eye-popping numbers, the real cost may stretch beyond the dollars and cents involved in design, marketing and other expenses, when you include the intangible “goodwill” associated with the company that can be lost or diluted in a rebranding exercise.</p>
<h3>What is goodwill?</h3>
<p>In the oft-cited definition of goodwill in the words of British judge Lord MacNaghten, it is the attractive force that brings in custom. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business. While goodwill attaches to the business and not to any particular name or mark, the brand name is usually the most important indication of a good’s origin. The brand name is thus a significant factor of the business’s goodwill.</p>
<p>What this means is that, for a business that has existed for a long time and has enjoyed a good reputation, its goodwill may be worth several times more than its annual revenue or its tangible assets. Sadly, the history of corporate rebranding features far too many instances where such valuable goodwill had been squandered.</p>
<p>When Hedi Slimane took over as creative director of Céline in 2018, he was tasked to triple the revenue of the then-73-year-old French pret-a-porter brand over the next five years. He quickly dropped the accent over the first instance of the letter “e” and wiped out the firm’s Instagram account, signalling a new direction.</p>
<p>Market watchers widely expected that his strategy will include replacing former design chief’s Phoebe Philo’s luxurious, minimalist look with an edgier style he was known for when he was at rival Saint Laurent. Reviews of Slimane’s debut designs for Celine were savage. Philophiles – the fans of Phoebe Philo – were appalled. They snapped up designs carrying the old name, unimpressed by the unwelcome change in aesthetics, driving second hand prices up 30 per cent. That missing accent was not just a missing stroke.</p>
<p>While the short term reactions were clearly negative, whether in the long term Slimane’s changes will result in a more profitable Celine is still uncertain (its owner LVMH does not break down individual brand figures).</p>
<h3>Change for change’s sake</h3>
<p>A rebranding is inherently a highly challenging and risky move. Academic studies are few, but one that examined the corporate rebranding of a leading telecommunications firm showed that common pitfalls included brands disconnecting with its core; stakeholders not seeing the bigger picture; too much emphasis placed on the label and not the meaning; and the difficulty in managing multiple identities in larger businesses.</p>
<p>Thus, change should be strategic and not be for its own sake. Twinings Tea has retained its current logo for 232 years and remained in the same operating location on London’s Strand since its founding in 1706. Chanel, one of the most desirable fashion brands in the world, has not changed its double C logo since its creation in 1925. Chupa Chups, whose logo was designed in 1969 by the one and only Salvador Dali, has also kept the arrestingly bright daisy-shaped emblem atop the lollipop for generations.</p>
<p>When a rebranding is absolutely necessary, one way to retain the goodwill associated with the old name is to retain part of the original name. Like Apple, Inc., Dunkin’ Donuts was renamed Dunkin’ to signal its focus on coffee and other offerings instead of purely donuts. Another solution is to incorporate a new holding company, leaving the original name intact as the name of a subsidiary, like what Google did with Alphabet.</p>
<p>But don’t be like Royal Mail, which learnt the hard way that badly thought-out name changes can confuse and infuriate customers. It had spent £2.5 million (S$4.2 million) to conjure up “Consignia” to replace “British Royal Mail”, only to be forced to backtrack a year later at a cost of another £1 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Duterte has proposed “Maharlika” as his favoured substitution for the Philippines. The ancient Tagalog word is thought to mean “nobility”. That might not be a good idea due to its tainted connotations: Maharlika was also the choice of Ferdinand Marcos, the late murderous dictator whose wife, Imelda, has been forever immortalised as the first lady with the shoe fetish.</p>
<p>Plus, some historians have traced the origins of the term further back to Sanskrit, where it means “man of ability”. To which a handful had translated, perhaps facetiously, to “big phallus”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clients who come to see me about commercial disputes often ask for the same thing: fast resolution. I tell them that there are two tried-and-tested ways to resolve financial claims. First, you can litigate in court and have a judge make a legal ruling on the dispute, in the full gaze of the public. Or you can go to arbitration, and have an arbitrator do the same, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>However, companies (especially Asian ones) traditionally dislike both options. For one thing, whichever route you choose, you lose control of the outcome. For another, whatever the result, the two disputing companies are unlikely to resume a commercial relationship.</p>
<p>Over the years, lawyers have been exploring a third way: mediation. Mediation is a process where the two disputing parties sit in a closed room, with an independent party called a mediator. Unlike the judge or arbitrator, the mediator doesn’t make any rulings. The mediator simply facilitates discussions, using techniques and strategies to bring the two sides closer together. The disputing parties are in charge.</p>
<p>In fact, mediation may be a lawyer-free zone, because the whole point of mediation is to put aside the law and focus on the commercial solutions. It’s not so much a fight as it is a negotiation. It’s a kinder, gentler (and faster and cheaper) way to settle disputes – get everyone in a room, let them vent, rant, talk it out, and then emerge with a new deal.</p>
<p>Feuding companies that manage to thrash out a deal in mediation are quite likely to continue doing business in future. And for Asian companies, sometimes, winning a court case is cold comfort if it also means that they lose a long-term relationship.</p>
<h3>Lacking teeth?</h3>
<p>Global surveys show that over 80 per cent of cases that undergo mediation are settled on the same day, with many more being settled thereafter. However, in my experience clients have shunned having their disputes resolved through mediation because of the difficulty in cross-border enforcement.</p>
<p>Picture this: a supplier from the fictitious country of Manufacturia has a dispute with a customer from the equally made-up country of Costa Lotta. The customer signed a contract with the supplier, but doesn’t want to pay the supplier in accordance with the contract. They both come to Singapore to mediate (because this is a neutral ground). After a day at the Singapore Mediation Centre, they negotiate a deal. They sign a settlement agreement. Then they return home.</p>
<p>A month later, the folks from Costa Lotta decide that they simply don’t want to honour the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement doesn’t have any legal force in Costa Lotta, or in Manufacturia. Unfortunately, all that the Manufacturians can do is to sue the Costa Lotta over the original contract.</p>
<p>It’s back to square one.</p>
<p>So that’s the main reason clients drag their feet about going to mediation: uncertainty over cross-border enforcement.</p>
<h3>A new solution: teeth!</h3>
<p>The UN Commission on International Trade Law now has a fix for this problem, with a new international treaty which allows settlement agreements that arise from mediation to be enforced internationally, in any of the countries that ratify the treaty.</p>
<p>As Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam puts it, the treaty fills a “missing piece” in the international dispute resolution enforcement framework, which currently includes the New York Convention for arbitration as well as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. This treaty will short-cut the legal process involved, so that parties to such settlement agreements will be able to have them recognised in the domestic courts of those countries.</p>
<p>What does this mean, in practical terms?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to our example involving the Manufacturia supplier and the Costa Lotta customer. Let’s assume that the countries of Manufacturia and Costa Lotta sign the new international treaty. Then, the Manufacturia supplier can (under the new treaty) sue the Costa Lotta customer in Costa Lotta (or in fact in any country that has signed the new treaty) to enforce the settlement agreement that they signed in Singapore. It’s cross-border dispute resolution with teeth and truly a historic milestone for dispute resolution.</p>
<p>The official name of the treaty is the “UN Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation”, alternatively known as the “Singapore Convention on Mediation”. This is the first treaty concluded under the auspices of the UN to be named after our city-state. The Singapore Convention will take its place among the more famous treaties named after other cities, such as the Geneva Conventions (on human rights), the Vienna Convention (on diplomatic relations) and the Paris Agreement (on climate change).</p>
<h3>Singapore, one-stop dispute resolution hub</h3>
<p>Naming the treaty after Singapore is quite apt. Internationally, countries recognise that Singapore leads the way in promoting this friendlier and kinder way of dispute resolution. For example, we have set up the Singapore International Mediation Centre to facilitate cross-border disputes and the Singapore International Mediation Institute to train and set standards for mediators in the region.</p>
<p>This is on top of Singapore’s growing reputation as a holistic dispute resolution hub, whether the process involves litigation, arbitration or mediation. In a poll commissioned by the Singapore Academy of Law and conducted by research firm Ipsos published in April 2019, 63 per cent of the 606 legal practitioners and in-house counsel engaging in cross-border transactions in Asia picked the Lion City as their preferred venue to resolve disputes. This is 11 percentage points more than in 2015.</p>
<p>The Singapore International Arbitration Centre handles one of the world’s largest administered caseloads, receiving more than 400 cases in 2018, compared to the London Court of International Arbitration’s 317. And earlier this year, Singapore and China inked a deal to establish an international mediation panel here to resolve disputes arising from projects under China&#8217;s Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony for the Singapore Convention will take place here in Singapore on 7 August 2019, just a couple of days before National Day. This is quite a sweet birthday gift from the UN member states for our Bicentennial and goes a long way in recognising this little island’s big voice in calling for international disputes to be settled according to the law.</p>

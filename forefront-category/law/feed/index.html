										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ingenious lawyers all over the Commonwealth are dreaming up rigmaroles for the signing of wills amid the pandemic. An English law firm has suggested that the will be signed at a park bench, with witnesses lurking nearby, ready to rotate around the document. Another option allows for the will to be signed at the person’s doorway while the witnesses stand outside, using the services of a well-trained pet to deliver the signed will to the witnesses.</p>
<p>Singapore has passed many sensible temporary measures in response to Covid-19 disruption, including marrying couples remotely so that the newly-weds, witnesses and solemniser need not be physically present. Yet, such proximity remains required for an important life admin – the execution of a valid will.</p>
<p>Like many Commonwealth countries, Singapore’s Wills Act mandates the presence and signatures of two witnesses, neither of whom are beneficiaries, making the process of executing a valid will onerous during this time.</p>
<p>The current law is doing a disservice to people who want to sort out their affairs – especially during a time when life is potentially more fragile. Demand for will writing in the UK has reportedly jumped by 76 per cent. Here, fewer than 15 to 20 per cent of Singaporeans are estimated to have made a will.</p>
<h3>Why wills are important</h3>
<p>A cynical reader may be thinking that making a will might be unnecessary because his estate would be dealt with automatically under the Intestate Succession Act upon death. However, intestacy – that is, not having made a will before one dies – is far from ideal. It causes delay and stress to surviving family members and may have unintended consequences. If a person leaves behind a spouse and child, the estate will go entirely to them, excluding his parents. This might not be what he would have wanted, especially if he had always taken care of his parents financially.</p>
<p>Recently, I was consulted over the affairs of a distant relative who had died intestate. He had a long-term partner, whose child he had considered to be his own despite there being no adoption. Under the laws of intestacy, they did not stand to inherit any of his property. Also, getting probate (or establishing legal validity) over his estate was formidable and expensive. All his five siblings, one of whom is currently overseas, had to file court documents to appoint an administrator. For siblings who passed away, death certificates had to be produced to the court. All these complications and expense would have been unnecessary if only he made a will.</p>
<h3>Why the law is designed this way</h3>
<p>The law’s insistence for the physical presence of two witnesses may be explained on the basis that it protects a person from fraud and coercion when signing a will. Lawyers, being creatures of tradition, have not seen it fit to change this law, which dates to the Victorian era.</p>
<p>But does this rationale still hold water in this time where video conferencing – even in High Court hearings – is ubiquitous? Why is the remote presence of witnesses not allowed? Is the rule which requires the physical presence of two witnesses, ultimately, merely a ghost from the past that is no longer relevant?</p>
<p>If so, the rule should be modified. As a wise judge once said in another context “[w]hen these ghosts of the past stand in the path of justice clanking their mediaeval chains the proper course… is to pass through them undeterred.”</p>
<h3>And why the law needs to change</h3>
<p>To facilitate the execution of valid wills, a temporary measure should be passed, like the solemnisation of marriages, to allow for a will to be executed with witnesses present remotely. Safeguards could be built to protect a person from fraud or coercion by insisting that a will may be executed by him only under his lawyer’s remote supervision with the remote presence of two witnesses.</p>
<p>An additional safeguard could be to insist that the execution process and the signed document be recorded by high-definition video. Singapore would not be the first country to introduce such a temporary measure. Some countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and many states in the United States, have allowed for witnesses and officials to appear by audio-video technology rather than in person. If such a temporary measure does not lead to further litigation, a strong case may be made that remote presence of witnesses should be allowed permanently.</p>
<p>Another casualty of the law mandating physical witnesses is the recognition of electronic wills. While revamping the law of wills that has stood close to nearly 200 years is a bold move, it is ultimately necessary to take into account the digital age that we live in. Several states in the United States like Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Indiana have already enacted legislation allowing for electronic wills. In fact, the Uniform Law Commission has approved and recommended for enactment the Uniform Electronic Wills Act in the United States. The UK Law Commission has also recently issued a consultation paper calling for views on enacting enabling legislation to cater for electronic wills.</p>
<p>Since the technology in relation to electronic wills may be developing, Singapore’s legislation may be drafted based on broad principles. First, and foremost, electronic signatures must be secure. Second, the legislation should not unduly prescribe the technology used because this might stifle innovation and commercial incentives to develop the necessary technology. Finally, any technology developed for electronic will-making must provide for a central repository that is safe from hacking, with access given to interested Government departments. The balance between these principles could be struck by conferring on the Minister of Law the power to recognise relevant technology that meets these criteria by way of subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p>The only good thing that has come out from this pandemic is that it has accelerated digital transformation in many organisations and our daily lives. In the age of ubiquitous smartphones and Wi-Fi, it does not make sense for us to be bound by an antiquated law that insists on physical proximity and pen on paper. Just as one can conclude and sign a multimillion-dollar contract electronically, one should also be able to execute a will digitally, with the proper safeguards built in.</p>
<p>While Singapore prides itself on being progressive in technology use in all life aspects, it seems strange that we have not modernised our laws in relation to technology and end-of-life planning issues. The Wills Act should be amended in a way that gives people the opportunity to make their wills in an accessible, convenient and secure manner. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Covid-19 crisis that began in Wuhan, China, brings to mind earlier epidemics.</p>
<p>In 2003, we were in the grip of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). It was the first pandemic in the era of the Internet, blogging and social media. Amid the panic about infections, one individual was widely labelled a “super spreader”. Her name and personal details were published. She was blamed for infecting over a hundred people in different countries. Her own family died of Sars. She survived, but was widely, and unjustly, criticised.</p>
<p>In 2009, the first H1N1 patient’s name was published. She, too, was cursed on social media, merely for unwittingly importing the virus.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020: If you found out the name of the first person infected by the coronavirus in Singapore, would you share it? You shouldn’t, because of a new anti-doxxing law that came into force last month.</p>
<h3>What is doxxing?</h3>
<p>To “doxx” means to identify someone publicly on the Internet. It’s a cyber weapon used to harass and victimise. Last year alone provided two memorable examples.</p>
<p>Just before Chinese New Year’s Eve last year, social media was ablaze with a video showing a dispute between a Gojek driver and his passenger. The argument culminated in an allegation of hostage-taking. The mainstream media piled in. Netizens leaked personal details of a person, supposedly the passenger in the video. Her name, photograph and workplace were shared online. Memes and jokes were spread to criticise and humiliate her.</p>
<p>And just before Deepavali, another social media clip made the rounds. It showed a condominium resident berating a security guard. The press reported it. Readers took sides. People circulated details of a person (supposedly the condo resident). His name, photograph, workplace and income were shared. But those details belonged to a completely different person who just happened to share a similar name and workplace. Nevertheless, a campaign was started to lobby his employer to sack him, and another group tried to put pressure to have him deported.</p>
<p>Doxxing is a bad thing. It’s carried out with malicious intent, in order to embarrass or harass a fellow human being. Doxxers expose your birth date, address, telephone number, employment information, and photographs of friends and family. The idea is to humiliate and destroy.</p>
<p>The victim might suffer in other ways. Because confidential information is disclosed, identity theft becomes a risk. Crooks can piece together someone’s personal information and misuse it. To make things worse, the Internet never forgets. Years from now, if that person applies for a job, and a prospective employer googles him, the doxxed information might reappear.</p>
<h3>Why do people doxx?</h3>
<p>We know doxxing is bad. But why do people do it? It happens when people become upset with a wrongdoer and feel that the wrongdoer will get away with bad behaviour. Usually, it isn’t anything as serious as a crime. The wrongdoer will not be punished by the authorities. So people feel that something must be done. They have to take matters into their own hands, to name and shame.</p>
<p>Doxxing is “street justice”. It increases as people lose confidence in society’s mechanisms to punish misdeeds. And doxxing is easy. Anyone can publish a photograph of you and name you, without your permission. That’s why we do so much of it on social media. Users happily fill up their Instagram and Facebook with pictures of people, without their consent, and with names tagged to faces. Add to that the anonymity of the Internet, and we have the perfect conditions for mob violence through doxxing.</p>
<h3>Anti-doxxing rules comes into force</h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Act doesn’t help. It regulates how companies and businesses have to safeguard our personal data, but it doesn’t control private citizens.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it is now illegal to publish identity information about someone, with the intention to harm that person. This has come about because of an amendment to the Protection from Harassment Act (confusingly abbreviated by lawyers as Poha).</p>
<p>The upgraded Poha makes it a crime to publish your identity information if it is done with a bad intention. Broadly speaking, that would be the intention to cause you harassment, alarm or distress (and that it does make you feel that way), or an intention to cause fear of violence or facilitate violence.</p>
<p>“Identity information” means any information which can help identify you: It includes your name, residential address, e-mail address, phone number, date of birth, NRIC or passport number, password, photo or video, and even your signature.</p>
<p>The amended Poha gives examples of what is okay and what is not. Here are two examples.</p>
<p>X and Y were formerly in a relationship. On social media, X accuses Y of promiscuity and posts photos of Y, together with Y’s mobile number, saying “contact her for a good time”. Y did not see the posts, but is harassed by calls and messages from strangers propositioning her.</p>
<p>Verdict? This is not okay. X is guilty of an offence. This is because X intended to cause Y to be harassed, and Y was in fact harassed. X can be jailed or fined.</p>
<p>Here’s another example: Q records a video of R driving recklessly. Q posts it in a chat group, where members share clips of dangerous driving, commenting: “Let’s avoid this.”</p>
<p>Verdict: This seems okay. Q didn’t intend to harm R. Q was trying to educate others.</p>
<p>So, intent is the key.</p>
<h3>Good, but it could be better</h3>
<p>Our Poha is a new and improved version of laws elsewhere. The United Kingdom and Australia have laws that may be used to prevent doxxing, but those laws were passed more than a dozen years ago, before social media became popular. The United States doesn’t appear to have a federal law criminalising doxxing, but it does have an anti-stalking law that can be used for certain situations. Most other countries don’t have any anti-doxxing laws. The Singapore law, coming into force this year, is the most recent and most specific.</p>
<p>There are still gaps. Our law says that you can’t post personal information if you intend to harass. I would like a rule which says you can’t publish certain types of information, no matter what the intention. For example, you shouldn’t be allowed to publish someone’s income, contact details, or health information, regardless of your intention. Once the information is on the Internet, it remains there forever. It will facilitate and enable future harassment.</p>
<h3>Antidotes to doxxing</h3>
<p>We lawyers know the laws aren’t a cure-all. Parliament can make doxxing illegal, but that doesn’t mean it will disappear. To stamp it out, we need to do more, as individuals and as a society.</p>
<p>As individuals, let’s fight the urge to share everything – with social media, it’s too easy to spread videos and messages quickly and unthinkingly. There will always be incidents where people will behave badly. We will be outraged or alarmed. But each of us has to pause to consider if we ought to be an agent for anger. Sometimes, it’s better to let matters cool than to act in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>As a society, we have to give the system time to work. The authorities, on their part, must be quick to watch for incidents that spark unrest and give offence. If action is needed, then that must be said, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This is where some of our politicians are more effective than others. Leaders who speak up quickly and clearly, on issues that capture the public’s attention, are doing their duty to dissuade doxxing. When people know the authorities are on top of things, and are taking a strong stand, people will feel less inclined to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>Doxxing happens as part of a wider social narrative. In the Gojek incident, it was about race. In the condominium resident case, it was elitism. For overseas epidemics, we might be dealing with xenophobia. It’s important for us, as a society, to challenge such narratives. So community leaders and thought leaders must speak up when harmful narratives are propagated. If too many of us take a back seat, then others will seize the microphone and influence the message.</p>
<h3>Will I be a victim?</h3>
<p>We’re all human. We get upset, and we say or do things that we regret. In this age of camera phones, it’s all too easy for us to be caught at our worst moments and for those moments to define us forever. How can we reduce the risk of being doxxed?</p>
<p>First, avoid being inflammatory on social media. The more you hurt people, the more likely people will want to get even. That’s just life.</p>
<p>Second, if you are ever in an argument, or in an altercation, try your best to see if anyone is recording it. If so, take steps to ask that person not to distribute the recording. Ask politely; don’t threaten. Threats seldom work, and often backfire.</p>
<p>Third, if you are portrayed online as a wrongdoer, take immediate steps to control the narrative. Make a public statement. Tell your side of the story. Apologise, if you should. Be the first to let your HR department know.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are doxxed, report it to the police. Doxxing is against the law. Protect your rights.</p>
<p>2019 was a bad year for doxxing. As we enter the Year of the Rat, let’s say goodbye to the year of mindless mouse-clicking. Let’s say goodbye to “The Year of the Doxx”.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of unverified information out there. Don’t be a super spreader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2019 has been a rollercoaster ride: Trump accelerates and then suddenly slams on the brakes on his tit-for-tat trade war with China. Hong Kong, hitherto the paradigm of pragmatism, lies smouldering as months of pro-democracy protests see no end. A Swedish girl (celebrating her 17th birthday just last Friday) becomes the unlikely face of environmentalism, shaming Boomers for doing nothing about climate change in front of the UN. The Nobel Prize eludes her but she bags <em>Time Magazine’s</em> Person of the Year instead. Defying odds, Boris Johnson scores a landslide win in the snap elections, possibly paving way to a Brexit that has eluded Britain for months and months.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the real estate market remains languid despite talk of capital flight from the Fragrant to safer harbours, PMDs are all but banned in a flurry of regulations, the Monica Baey sexual misconduct incident sets off a series of Me Too awakenings, POFMA passes into law (goodbye fake news sites?), and the AHTC trial makes a hitherto legalistic term “fiduciary” a household term.</p>
<p>Moving forward into a brave new 2020, in the last Forefront article, our head of IP &amp; TMT Adrian Tan has already predicted that China will issue its own state-backed cryptocurrency in its bid for tighter domestic control and wider world domination.</p>
<p>Here are what the other partners think will happen this year – some predictions being more far-out than others. But if there is anything that the extreme developments of the previous few years have shown, it is that the world has become an increasingly volatile place.</p>
<h3>Thio Shen Yi, SC (Dispute resolution)</h3>
<p>The exuberant march of madness of governments continues. The Representatives impeach Trump and a circus trial follows in the Senate, but not enough Republicans cross the floor to impeach him there as well. Trump therefore hangs onto the Presidency, manages not to start any wars, cold or otherwise, raises more campaign funds than anyone else, and gallops away to win a second term. Chaos ensues, but all the Democrats could do is to contemplate their navels. Four more years of the reality TV presidency. In the UK, Boris forms a government and makes a hard-ish Brexit happen with a border on the Irish Sea. The Scots call a referendum on independence and both sides of the Irish border start talking about invoking the Good Friday Agreement and also calling a referendum for a united Ireland. More chaos, and Boris responds strongly by calling the cries for referendums as “codswallop”. Only 10 per cent of the country understand him.</p>
<h3>Stefanie Yuen Thio (Corporate)</h3>
<p>Hong Kong’s troubles achieve no definitive resolution. No Chinese tanks roll in from Shenzhen, and certainly no concessions will be forthcoming from Beijing. But the windfall that some have predicted for Singapore doesn’t materialise. Rich Chinese will use the perceived opportunity to get the Singapore government to allow them more residential land buying rights, and dangle the carrot of increased investment to try to secure permanent residency. But aside from them parking more funds here, leading to fully sold high end condos that are only one quarter lived in, we will not see an exodus of economic activity from Hong Kong or the Mainland.</p>
<h3>Derek Loh (Construction &amp; Engineering)</h3>
<p>The ability of governments to implement policy, no matter how rational, is increasingly being held hostage by mob rule, challenging the rule of law and even democracy, as manifest in the continued unrest from Lebanon and Chile to Catalonia and Hong Kong, as well as civil disobedience across Western countries. The mainstream media continues to adopt an indulgent attitude towards these events, helping shape public opinion that protests, no matter how unreasonable or violent, are an acceptable alternative to the ballot box.</p>
<h3>Ong Pei Ching (IP &amp; TMT)</h3>
<p>The AI art market will become more established. In 2018, the first AI artwork sold at Christie’s, a portrait of a fictional aristocrat, fetched US$432,500 (S$584,000). This year, cold water was poured on the budding AI art market when Sotheby sold its first AI artwork, a digital show of portraits constantly being generated, for a fraction at US$52,634. However, as AI art moves away from copying human artwork (and portraiture), and starts a new art movement, AI art will become more commercially valuable for reasons other than novelty. The tough legal questions as regards intellectual property of such work may then be tested.</p>
<h3>Ian Lim (Employment &amp; Labour)</h3>
<p>Parliament will consider more comprehensive protection for whistle-blowers in 2020. Singaporeans are already gradually becoming more “woke” about speaking out responsibly to right wrongs, and this development will help Singaporean corporates be better governed and prevent corruption and harassment. Legislation will now need to gather the piecemeal protection presently scattered across various statutes to better protect genuine whistle-blowers from speaking out without fear of reprisal.</p>
<h3>Kelvin Koh (Trusts and Land Disputes)</h3>
<p>The battlefield for tech supremacy shifts to 5G. Facetime fossilises and 3D live-streaming is the new norm. With improved VR systems, we will see a fading gap between face-to-face meetings and virtual 3D engagements. As lawyers embrace the new legal tech, courtroom dramas start to play out in online court rooms with live 3D visuals of the judge and witnesses. Countries vying to be the top arbitration venue will face challenges from servers competing to host the next online arbitration. Singapore will have to rely more on chilli crabs and <em>bak kut teh</em> to draw disputants to resolve disputes physically here instead of logging on to new online arbitration forums. </p>
<h3>Jennifer Chia (Banking &amp; Finance; Corporate Real Estate)</h3>
<p>Everyone expects a real estate supply glut, but here’s a far-out (but far more interesting) prediction: the Singapore government, as part of its election campaign, lowers or abolishes ABSD rates and Trump truly bromances Xi after their trade deal, leading to an uptick to the Singapore property market in 2020. Boomtown Charlie!</p>
<h3>June Ho (Corporate)</h3>
<p>The Council for Board Diversity will gain momentum in connecting stakeholders in order to reach the target for 20 per cent females on all boards in 2020, marking a milestone for female empowerment. More women will be inspired to venture into the boardroom, knowing that they are not just ticking a box. Companies will seek worthy candidates from beyond the usual industries or sectors. Local investors may follow AustraliaSuper’s footsteps, halting investments in companies that lack female board representation. Engagement and support from men lead to increased diversity and inclusion, starting a virtuous cycle, empowering women at all levels at the workplace.</p>
<h3>Kishan Pillay (Construction &amp; Engineering)</h3>
<p>Looking to the skies, the promise of autonomous passenger-carrying drones will remain a blip on the horizon due to prohibitive implementation costs and unresolved safety concerns. But logistics companies may dabble in the technology. Singles Days will not be the same again, with gifts arriving from drone deliveries from sorting stations.</p>
<h3>Chee Chin Wi (Corporate)</h3>
<p>In other news, bubble tea gets served on business class.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clients who come to see me about commercial disputes often ask for the same thing: fast resolution. I tell them that there are two tried-and-tested ways to resolve financial claims. First, you can litigate in court and have a judge make a legal ruling on the dispute, in the full gaze of the public. Or you can go to arbitration, and have an arbitrator do the same, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>However, companies (especially Asian ones) traditionally dislike both options. For one thing, whichever route you choose, you lose control of the outcome. For another, whatever the result, the two disputing companies are unlikely to resume a commercial relationship.</p>
<p>Over the years, lawyers have been exploring a third way: mediation. Mediation is a process where the two disputing parties sit in a closed room, with an independent party called a mediator. Unlike the judge or arbitrator, the mediator doesn’t make any rulings. The mediator simply facilitates discussions, using techniques and strategies to bring the two sides closer together. The disputing parties are in charge.</p>
<p>In fact, mediation may be a lawyer-free zone, because the whole point of mediation is to put aside the law and focus on the commercial solutions. It’s not so much a fight as it is a negotiation. It’s a kinder, gentler (and faster and cheaper) way to settle disputes – get everyone in a room, let them vent, rant, talk it out, and then emerge with a new deal.</p>
<p>Feuding companies that manage to thrash out a deal in mediation are quite likely to continue doing business in future. And for Asian companies, sometimes, winning a court case is cold comfort if it also means that they lose a long-term relationship.</p>
<h3>Lacking teeth?</h3>
<p>Global surveys show that over 80 per cent of cases that undergo mediation are settled on the same day, with many more being settled thereafter. However, in my experience clients have shunned having their disputes resolved through mediation because of the difficulty in cross-border enforcement.</p>
<p>Picture this: a supplier from the fictitious country of Manufacturia has a dispute with a customer from the equally made-up country of Costa Lotta. The customer signed a contract with the supplier, but doesn’t want to pay the supplier in accordance with the contract. They both come to Singapore to mediate (because this is a neutral ground). After a day at the Singapore Mediation Centre, they negotiate a deal. They sign a settlement agreement. Then they return home.</p>
<p>A month later, the folks from Costa Lotta decide that they simply don’t want to honour the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement doesn’t have any legal force in Costa Lotta, or in Manufacturia. Unfortunately, all that the Manufacturians can do is to sue the Costa Lotta over the original contract.</p>
<p>It’s back to square one.</p>
<p>So that’s the main reason clients drag their feet about going to mediation: uncertainty over cross-border enforcement.</p>
<h3>A new solution: teeth!</h3>
<p>The UN Commission on International Trade Law now has a fix for this problem, with a new international treaty which allows settlement agreements that arise from mediation to be enforced internationally, in any of the countries that ratify the treaty.</p>
<p>As Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam puts it, the treaty fills a “missing piece” in the international dispute resolution enforcement framework, which currently includes the New York Convention for arbitration as well as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. This treaty will short-cut the legal process involved, so that parties to such settlement agreements will be able to have them recognised in the domestic courts of those countries.</p>
<p>What does this mean, in practical terms?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to our example involving the Manufacturia supplier and the Costa Lotta customer. Let’s assume that the countries of Manufacturia and Costa Lotta sign the new international treaty. Then, the Manufacturia supplier can (under the new treaty) sue the Costa Lotta customer in Costa Lotta (or in fact in any country that has signed the new treaty) to enforce the settlement agreement that they signed in Singapore. It’s cross-border dispute resolution with teeth and truly a historic milestone for dispute resolution.</p>
<p>The official name of the treaty is the “UN Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation”, alternatively known as the “Singapore Convention on Mediation”. This is the first treaty concluded under the auspices of the UN to be named after our city-state. The Singapore Convention will take its place among the more famous treaties named after other cities, such as the Geneva Conventions (on human rights), the Vienna Convention (on diplomatic relations) and the Paris Agreement (on climate change).</p>
<h3>Singapore, one-stop dispute resolution hub</h3>
<p>Naming the treaty after Singapore is quite apt. Internationally, countries recognise that Singapore leads the way in promoting this friendlier and kinder way of dispute resolution. For example, we have set up the Singapore International Mediation Centre to facilitate cross-border disputes and the Singapore International Mediation Institute to train and set standards for mediators in the region.</p>
<p>This is on top of Singapore’s growing reputation as a holistic dispute resolution hub, whether the process involves litigation, arbitration or mediation. In a poll commissioned by the Singapore Academy of Law and conducted by research firm Ipsos published in April 2019, 63 per cent of the 606 legal practitioners and in-house counsel engaging in cross-border transactions in Asia picked the Lion City as their preferred venue to resolve disputes. This is 11 percentage points more than in 2015.</p>
<p>The Singapore International Arbitration Centre handles one of the world’s largest administered caseloads, receiving more than 400 cases in 2018, compared to the London Court of International Arbitration’s 317. And earlier this year, Singapore and China inked a deal to establish an international mediation panel here to resolve disputes arising from projects under China&#8217;s Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony for the Singapore Convention will take place here in Singapore on 7 August 2019, just a couple of days before National Day. This is quite a sweet birthday gift from the UN member states for our Bicentennial and goes a long way in recognising this little island’s big voice in calling for international disputes to be settled according to the law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all knew it was coming.</p>
<p>In a world where the call for minority shareholder protection is the corporate equivalent of the #MeToo movement, was it any surprise that the Singapore Exchange (SGX) would ring-fence minorities’ risks by changing its rules relating to voluntary delistings?  </p>
<p>To recap, under the new regime (“New Rules”), exit offers have to be both “fair” and “reasonable”, and neither the offeror nor its concert parties may vote on the delisting resolution. A fair price means the offer must at least match the share’s value. Reasonableness encompasses broader considerations such as the offerors’ voting control and the securities’ liquidity.</p>
<p>This dichotomy has led to several delistings at prices that the independent financial advisers (IFA) had opined were not fair but were reasonable, including the now-infamous Vard Holdings case that prompted the changes. Other offers suffering from split personality disorder include those for China Minzhong and CWG International, as well as Keppel Corp’s take-private of Keppel Land.</p>
<p>At a principle level, it makes sense. Investors buying listed shares want an exchange in which to trade. Privatisation is a draconian gesture: sell me your shares or – cue evil laughter – I will remove the market for them. It should be exercised without conflict of interest or self-dealing.</p>
<p>That the New Rules came about due to the shareholder furore over Vard’s “lowball” delisting offer, which many had considered to have taken advantage of a cyclical slump in the shipbuilding industry, shows the regulator’s openness to constructive – and clamorous – feedback. More closely aligning our rules with those of our friendly competitor, Hong Kong, where controlling shareholders may not vote, is another plus. It is so tiresome to be continually compared unfavourably to the Fragrant Harbour, after all. (Although Beijing probably envies our ability to put down the Little India riot in a matter of hours, compared to weeks of unhappy uprising over the SAR’s extradition bill.)  </p>
<p>Commentators have been generally positive about the development, with <em>The Edge Singapore</em> calling the move “commendable”. And while it is good that the SGX is constantly refining the rulebook to stay relevant to shareholder concerns, it is also worth taking a harder look at the roll-out of the New Rules.</p>
<h3>Raising the barriers to exit</h3>
<p>A key implication of the New Rules is that they do not apply to just the SGX’s voluntary delistings procedure, which allows a company to be delisted if a resolution that satisfies the voting thresholds is passed and the offeror makes a reasonably priced exit offer. But some delistings are achieved via schemes of arrangement and takeover offers. So, as part of its comprehensive overhaul, the SGX will now apply the “fair and reasonable” requirement to these too.</p>
<p>For schemes, this effectively means that the regulator will not approve shareholder circulars for such arrangements unless the price is both fair and reasonable. At first blush, this does not appear to be a deal-breaker – recent schemes have all cleared the hurdle. However, as we enter a shakier economy with more corporate failures being reported, debt restructurings via schemes of arrangement involving the rights of creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders such as perpetual securities holders, will become more common. Such schemes are not principally targeted at delisting and will typically involve protracted financial bartering. Looking out for the interests of only one group – the minority shareholders – by insisting on a minimum exit price may not be equitable to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>The New Rules will also change how companies delist after a takeover offer. Previously, if a takeover resulted in the loss of a 10 per cent public float, the SGX would generally allow a delisting. Now, if the offeror does not gather enough acceptances to trigger a compulsory acquisition under the Companies Act, the SGX is unlikely to agree to the delisting unless the offer terms satisfy the New Rules. In this scenario, the listed company will be suspended, but must continue complying with listing rules and incur the associated costs.</p>
<p>This has two implications. First, offerors will think twice before using a takeover as a delisting device unless they are confident they will be able to exercise the squeeze-out right. Large controlling shareholders are unlikely to choose this path because the squeeze-out imposes a higher bar, requiring acceptances in respect of 90 per cent of the shares not held by them and their related corporations. This is unless they are able to exploit the Companies Act loophole and use a vehicle that, while being owned by them, is not technically a related corporation, as Ron Sim did when he privatised OSIM.</p>
<p>The second implication is this: the minority shareholder who did not accept the offer may well find himself holding shares in a company that continues to be listed on, and subject to the compliance rules of, the SGX, but with no ready market. The SGX is betting on offerors not wanting such a situation and upping their offer terms accordingly.</p>
<h3>Excluding concert parties</h3>
<p>The New Rules disqualify the offeror’s “concert party group” from voting on the delisting resolution. This term, which takes its definition from the Takeover Code, is extremely wide. It does not just include parties who are actually working together in the delisting; there is an assumption that a plethora of collateral players, from directors of associated companies and their relatives, to the offeror’s professional advisers, are deemed to also be acting in concert unless proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Questions abound. How will a listed company ensure that individuals on the margins of the definition do not vote on the resolution? Is that even its responsibility? If not, what is the point of having a regulation that is so unwieldy and difficult to enforce? And what if a delisting resolution is ostensibly passed but it is later alleged that concert parties had inadvertently voted? That is not a headache I envy the SGX. Surely it would be simpler, and more appropriate, to restrict those parties who are in fact working together with the offeror from voting?</p>
<h3>Are the New Rules nice or necessary?</h3>
<p>Shareholder protection is a good thing – research shows that it is critical in developing a strong capital market. The New Rules also align us more closely with Hong Kong where premiums for privatisation offers are significantly higher than those here.</p>
<p>But were they necessary? The old listing rules already had safeguards built in. Voluntary delistings would fail if 10 per cent or more of the shareholders vote against the resolution. In the case of schemes, these are already under the jurisdiction of the High Court, a forum where all stakeholders can air their concerns.</p>
<p>A cursory examination of the past two years’ delistings reveals that many have met the “fair and reasonable” test. And even those that didn’t were able to be privatised through a compulsory acquisition, save for Vard. This begs the question: will the changes result in higher exit offers?</p>
<p>What the New Rules do is sound a populist gong. The Vard case generated a lot of media attention, with shareholders’ unhappiness over the low exit price spilling over into complaints about non-material errors in the IFA’s analysis and improper voting procedures. The SGX is signalling that it is open to change. It is to be hoped that the New Rules will also open up the cheque books of offerors to unlock shareholder value, rather than close the door to IPO aspirants wary of an over-regulated bourse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was meant to be one of the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) success stories. One of our biggest skincare companies, Best World International saw its profits grow almost 40 fold between 2013 and 2017. It was valued at S$1.8 billion at its peak in February 2019.</p>
<p>The stock lost its lustre when shocking allegations of wrongdoing by short-seller Bonitas Research and further pressure by the authorities forced the mainboard-listed company into clarifying its previous denials, confessing that the owner of its largest client, import agent Changsha Best, was in fact Best World’s CEO’s brother-in-law. Its share price plunged nine per cent as it halted its trading on 24 April 2019.</p>
<p>Said the SGX: “The revelation of the relationship between Changsha Best and the company’s CEO and managing director raises serious concerns about the veracity of China sales conducted under the export model from 2015 to 2018 and whether these were conducted on normal commercial terms.”</p>
<h3>Once bitten, twice shy</h3>
<p>For S-chip naysayers, Best World International’s fall from grace is hardly a blip on the radar. It is but the latest in a string of scandals that began as far back as 2004, when China Aviation Oil (CAO) engaged in speculative trading that led to massive losses of US$547 million (S$740 million). Its traders had ignored the company’s own regulations to limit losses, leading to its bankruptcy. The case went down in history as Singapore’s biggest corporate scandal since rogue trader Nick Leeson caused 233-year-old British merchant bank Barings to collapse in 1995.</p>
<p>Or take China Gaoxian Fibre Fabric Holdings Ltd’s trading suspension in 2011. The yarn maker’s stock was one of 2009’s biggest IPOs, listed half a year after measures were implemented to clean up after previous S-chip irregularities. One of its independent directors was SGX ex-listings head Philip Chan. Yet, special auditors found that the company had not only RMB1 billion (S$197 million) missing from its bank accounts, but also was in more debt than previously disclosed.  </p>
<p>Finally, the trading halt of China Fibretech Ltd. in 2015 after three customers lodged claims against the fabric processing services provider for substantial damages and financial losses. This had resulted in RMB450 million being paid out without the necessary corporate authorisations.</p>
<p>To rub salt into the wound, seven out of 25 new entrants to the SGX watch list for not meeting the minimum trading price requirements and/or the financial entry criteria on 4 June 2019 were S-chips. Together with years of high-profile S-chip failures, this has created the impression that such companies are no longer fit for listing on the SGX-ST. But is that really the case?</p>
<h3>Reasons for optimism</h3>
<p>Given the abysmal public perception of S-chip stocks, the SGX may be seen as being too optimistic with its continued wooing of such companies. Yet, recently, larger S-chips such as Dasin Retail Trust, China Jinjiang Environment and EC World Asset Management have been listed on the SGX-ST.</p>
<p>The hard numbers suggest that some degree of confirmation bias may be at work. In our analysis of the recent editions of the SGX’s “Report on Long-Suspended Companies”, the proportion of S-chips listed has in fact declined over the past three years.</p>
<p>One such turnaround story is China Fibretech, which resumed trading in September 2018 on the SGX-ST as Raffles Infrastructure after almost three years’ suspension. Reversing out of the red, it reported 2Q2019 earnings of RMB24.5 million, a stark difference when compared to a net loss of RMB974,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Nor do S-chips form the majority of suspended companies listed on the last two versions of the SGX report: only five out of the 15 new entrants are such companies. In other words, S-chips are not the only corporate failures. One non-S-chip example is water resources giant Hyflux, which had pursued growth aggressively at the expense, some commentators have noted, of appropriate risk management, resulting in what could possibly become the largest insolvency in local history. Noble Group is another spectacular debacle. Accused of accounting fraud, it had its credit rating downgraded to junk. The former high-flying commodities trader recorded net losses of US$1.7 billion in 2015 and was delisted from the SGX last year.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in recent years, S-chips have been cleaning up their act in corporate governance. Comeback kid CAO, which is arguably the pioneer of the scandalous image of S-chips, turned its fortune around – steadily climbing from 330th position in 2009 in terms of its Governance &amp; Transparency Index to a peak position of 25th in 2017.</p>
<p>In any event, the SGX is not sitting on its laurels, and has been taking steps to improve its position as the premier platform on which S-chips may list.</p>
<p>Proposed in 2011 and effected in 2014 was the requirement for companies listed on the SGX-ST (including S-chips) to hold annual general meetings in Singapore. This change substantially improved shareholder access to the directors and managements of listed companies, by having them physically present to address investor concerns.</p>
<p>More recently in 2018, the bourse and the Chinese Embassy in Singapore had entered into talks in connection with the proposed requirement for state-owned enterprises or mainland cornerstone investors (including sovereign wealth funds and state-linked investment vehicles) as shareholders in an S-chip before listing may be permitted on the SGX-ST. Although not much is known about the discussions, getting China on board with the SGX to strengthen the supervision and accountability of the country’s companies listed here will surely help boost investor confidence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SGX had entered into agreements with the likes of the China Chamber of International Commerce and the Zhejiang (S) Entrepreneurs Association with the intention to promote Singapore as a choice location for Chinese companies looking to expand their businesses internationally.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the momentum picking up for S-chips coupled with the effort put in by the different stakeholders, it is unrealistic to expect all S-chips to be “Saint”-chips, and unfair to paint them all as “Scam”-chips.</p>
<h3>The road ahead</h3>
<p>In any case, China is a market that Singapore can ill afford to ignore. While growth in the People’s Republic may have tapered off to a 28-year low of 6.6 per cent, it still remains the world’s second largest economy – first, if ranked by purchasing power parity.</p>
<p>China’s economic development strategies – Made in China 2025 and Belt Road Initiative – will continue to provide its people with opportunities to invest, cultivate export markets and boost incomes and domestic consumption. In order for PRC companies to take advantage of such opportunities, they will need to offer securities to the public in exchange for capital.</p>
<p>Since the early days of the Chinese economy’s phenomenal expansion, its companies have been primarily listing in Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States. The two Asian exchanges had an edge over the United States’ due to, among other reasons, lower language barriers. The likelihood of listing in America has decreased even further due to the straining relationship between the two economic powerhouses due to the ongoing trade war. Consequently, China may be looking for a less hostile environment to conduct its business or list its companies.</p>
<p>Public unhappiness over the now-suspended extradition bill has led to massive demonstrations in Hong Kong, with the biggest flashpoint to-date being the storming of the LegCo building on the 22nd anniversary of the handover. In the build-up of the unrest, it has already been reported that funds from the special administrative region are looking for safer, more fragrant harbours.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters, the London-based chief executive of a mid-sized European private wealth advisory firm has revealed that it is launching its Asia arm in the Lion City instead of its earlier decision to set up in Hong Kong, because “what we are seeing [in Hong Kong] doesn’t give us much confidence.”</p>
<p>In an earlier story from the same news agency, a financial adviser claimed to be involved in a tycoon’s US$100 million transfer from a Hong Kong-based Citibank account to a Singapore-based one. The adviser said: “It’s started. We’re hearing others are doing it, too, but no-one is going to go on parade that they are leaving.”</p>
<p>Singapore has long kept up a friendly rivalry with Hong Kong. While we cannot compete with its ready access to mainland capital, we can provide a safer harbour for Chinese investments in the current political and economic climate. The SGX’s efforts to enhance its listing rules and corporate governance standards get us half way there. It’s time for the market to stop talking down China’s businesses and start welcoming high-quality listing applicants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beyond Meat Inc. makes cows happy and cardiologists sad. Its Beyond Burger uses no meat and has no cholesterol, and contains less fat, fewer calories and more protein than a typical burger. Yet, in taste tests around the world, diners are astonished to discover that the plant-based sandwich offering is virtually indistinguishable – in flavour, texture and appearance – from the beef-based fare that they are familiar with.</p>
<p>The promise of this new-fangled product is reflected in the company’s recent IPO, which stunned market-watchers when its stock price almost tripled from US$25 (S$34) to a high of US$72 on the first trading day – enough to make cattle jump over the moon.</p>
<h3>East meats West</h3>
<p>Many believe that Beyond Burger and its ilk to be yet another Western innovation. We in the East know this to be fake news. Asians may be blasé about bogus burgers and make-believe meat, because many of us are vegetarian for ethical reasons. After all, for centuries the Chinese have been serving mock mutton, pretend pork, fake fish and deceptive duck. Made of wheat gluten, soya, agar and other plant-based ingredients, these are the result of the culinary creativity of Buddhist monks. In neighbouring India, vegetarianism has long taken root. An estimated half a billion Indians eschew meat, and chew tofu, cheese and lentils instead.</p>
<p>So it is not just fake news, it is old news. But because of Beyond Meat’s success, which has whetted appetites for further vegan-pleasing meat substitutes, meat producers are starting to take notice of the threat to their businesses and may be roused to stampede. Meat industry groups are lobbying to prevent such bogus burgers from being labelled with words such as “meat”, “beef” or “pork”. This recalls the US court cases that the dairy industry fought to prevent others from using “butter”, “margarine”, “yoghurt”, “milk” or even “soy milk” in their product names.</p>
<p>In Europe, a huge legal battle spanning half a decade was waged over the word “champagne”. The producers of the famous bubbly beverage, through their lobbyists, fought and lost their bid to stop a sorbet maker from using “champagne” to market its dessert. The European Court of Justice said that it was okay to do so because, well, the sorbet really did taste like champagne. One can only imagine the arduous tasting sessions that the members of the legal fraternity had to endure in their pursuit of justice. It is a sobering thought.</p>
<h3>Can corporates weaponise Pofma?</h3>
<p>The point is this: businesses fight disinformation and protect their brands by using tried-and-tested laws relating to intellectual property and unfair competition. Here in Singapore, though, we may have gained a new weapon in the legal arsenal.</p>
<p>After two days of marathon parliamentary debates, on 8 May lawmakers voted to pass the fake news law, or to use its official name, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. With typical Singaporean brevity, the law has been nicknamed “Pofma”.</p>
<p>So far, the focus has been on Pofma’s use in social and political situations. But here is an interesting question: can Pofma be used in a corporate context? Specifically, can listcos use Pofma to fight fake news?</p>
<p>Businesses live and die by their reputation. One of my clients manufactures a popular range of baby food in Asia. A wild rumour began circulating on Internet forums that its wares had been tampered with. Eventually, we tracked down the source of the falsehood to someone who had borne a grudge against my client. She had completely made up the allegation to get even. We shut down the fake news – but not before some parents had read it, and became upset and worried that their children would fall ill after consuming my client’s products.</p>
<p>With social media, gossip and scandal can go viral, harming brands, businesses and people. A short-seller targeting a particular company may spread its malicious analysis to sink the share price overnight, causing loss to investors for its own gain. If the disinformation is vicious enough, it can even destabilise the market.</p>
<p>Having analysed Pofma, here is how I think it can be used to fight hoaxes, innuendo and lies spread by unscrupulous competitors or traders to target a particular company.</p>
<h3>A step-by-step guide</h3>
<p>First, the business has to identify a false statement that has been put online.</p>
<p>Second, the business has to explain why that statement causes harm to the public. For example, the business can show that the false statement causes panic among consumers or investors.</p>
<p>Third, the business can then ask the authorities to order the false statement to be corrected or removed.</p>
<p>That is all it takes. It is faster and cheaper than the old way, where the business had to engage forensic experts, track down and identify the wrongdoer, serve legal papers on him/her/it wherever they are on the planet, go to court to argue to obtain an injunction, serve the injunction on the wrongdoer, and then have many, many follow-up hearings.</p>
<p>It may have been an unintended consequence, but Pofma could work as a tool for honest businesses to protect themselves against dishonest competitors and short-sellers. And that is enough for me to raise a glass of champagne sorbet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Breached data</h3>
<p>On 12 February 2019, Singapore’s Health Minister revealed that confidential details of 14,200 HIV-positive people, stolen from a government public health database, had been leaked online by a disgruntled US citizen who had been in a romantic relationship with a local doctor.</p>
<p>The ministry has come under fire for the breach and for only belatedly informing those affected, having discovered the theft almost three years ago in 2016. Such sensitive information, in the wrong hands, might affect the individual’s employment, insurance and social standing.</p>
<p>This comes hard on the heels of “the most serious breach of personal data” in Singapore’s history, when hackers infiltrated SingHealth’s servers. The “deliberate, targeted and well-planned cyber-attack” on the nation’s largest group of public healthcare institutions reaped a haul of 1.5 million patient records, including those of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
<p>Yet, these vastly visible hacks are merely the tip of the iceberg, highlighting just how vulnerable we are in an age where so much personal information is stored online. A disruptive technological force, Big Data often works stealthily. Do we really know how it is impacting us?</p>
<h3>Big data</h3>
<p>Facebook has over 2 billion monthly active users: people who trustingly fill in their birthdays, upload and tag their pictures, like and comment on news articles and click “Shop Now” when a sponsored link showing an item on sale pops onto the feed.</p>
<p>This behaviour applies across social media platforms, which harvest the information from users’ Internet activity to send them targeted advertising or posts. Click on an article about Brexit and similar content will show up on your feed. Blurb about your upcoming holiday to New York and sites recommending Broadway musicals appear on your browser. No, they’re not reading your mind; that’s Big Data mining what you read. And write. And share. And consume.</p>
<p>These examples are relatively benign – to the security-conscious user, they will be a source of irritation; to the online shopper, a boon of convenience.</p>
<p>Social media and search engines profit from mining our data, making money from advertisers eager to push out commercials and content customised for each user’s preferences. The higher probability that you will buy the recommended items in turn maximises advertisers’ revenue. That’s why Google lets you use its search engine for free and Facebook can promise that it will never charge you for the use of its services. If you are not paying, you become the product on sale.</p>
<p>But the uses of Big Data have morphed into something more sinister.</p>
<h3>Bad boy</h3>
<p>In a series of admissions between March and April 2018, Facebook revealed that a quiz called “thisisyourdigitallife” published on its platform was used to harvest the personal data from 87 million profiles without users’ consent.</p>
<p>Analysts say that consulting firm Cambridge Analytica bought this large trove of data as a tool to influence political outcomes such as the 2018 Mexican general election and the 2016 Brexit referendum. Voters were identified based on demographic data such as location, age and gender, which could be used to predict voting patterns. They were then fed tailored campaign messages in a bid to shape their voting behaviour.</p>
<p>The data analytics firm had also used data harvested for psychological profiling of US voters, creating a powerful database that reportedly helped carry Mr Trump to victory in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Armed with petabytes of historical user data, social media platforms are able to push out more content on the readers’ newsfeed based on their past preferences. This creates an echo chamber, giving users the often mistaken impression that many others in the cyberworld share their beliefs – and prejudices – and hence reinforcing those views. Troll farms based in Russia and Iran have reportedly been co-opting this mechanism, releasing millions of tweets and posts to influence voter opinion and their intention to vote, in order to disrupt elections.</p>
<h3>Big brother</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most horrifying potential use of accumulated personal data is in a nation-wide (or, someday, global) social credit system.</p>
<p>China has been at the forefront of constructing such an apparatus in which its citizens are tracked through a wide network of surveillance tools. Wrongdoers get their scores docked for “bad behaviour” such as lighting up in non-smoking areas, sharing fake news or violating traffic laws. Do-gooders are rewarded for participating in “good activities” such as donating blood or volunteering for charity work.</p>
<p>The consequences of having a poor credit score can be frightening. These range from curtailed travel and reduced Internet speeds to bans from certain jobs and public shaming. The latter involves having your photograph, name and offence displayed on cinema screens and on billboard-size displays at airports and shopping malls.</p>
<p>If you default on your debt in some cities, friends and family who ring you may be redirected to a message calling you out as a trust-breaker wanted by the courts. By the end of 2018, Chinese courts had banned would-be travellers from buying flights 17.5 million times, and blacklisted citizens were prevented from buying train tickets 5.5 million times. </p>
<h3>Buyer beware</h3>
<p>There are two immediate causes for concern.</p>
<p>First, governments can procure existing personal profiles from data mining companies. Such casual information – including Internet browsing history, sexuality or smoking habits – would have been disclosed naively and will now suddenly constitute official data, forming the basis for generating individuals’ default credit scores.</p>
<p>Second, such personal data is no less susceptible to data breaches and hacking. What is stopping a hacker from changing or faking the data to mess with the social credit scores of targeted individuals?</p>
<p>It may be too late to put the data genie back in the bottle, but we need to chain it.</p>
<p>Singapore has begun to take small steps to ensure that personal data is protected. For example, starting this September, businesses will no longer be allowed to collect National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) numbers or make copies of NRICs and passports.</p>
<p>But such measures are limited. Businesses need to be further regulated in how they use personal data and individuals should have the right to demand that any information they have provided to businesses and social media platforms be permanently wiped from databases.</p>
<p>Data collectors should also be put to a high standard of security – whether by imposing high monetary penalties or subjecting them to regular mandatory technology audits. The ability of governments to mine and make use of their citizens’ data should also be clearly prescribed, and the accuracy of such data ensured.</p>
<p>We’ve shared our Big Data freely with Big Brother. Time to let him know that it comes with strings attached.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese New Year Eve, 2019. Social media was ablaze with a viral video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPJ83I78r40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube link</a>) of an altercation between a Malay Gojek driver and his Chinese passenger objecting to a route that would incur ERP charges. The young woman’s histrionics when she was unable to open the car door, even with a Certis Cisco officer standing outside the stopped vehicle – “you’re taking me for hostage” (sic) and “is it because I’m Chinese?” – had Singaporeans spellbound.</p>
<p>In typical Singapore fashion, we were then treated to a flurry of parodies. Creative folks were inspired by the original viral video to create a wide range of messages, from pictorial memes to rap videos, with even some government agencies and corporations riffing off the incident to promote road safety and civil defence. Debates raged online as to the rights and wrongs of the duo, examining every aspect of the dispute: social, racial, or geographical.</p>
<p>After all, in today’s social media-driven world, virtually every discussion starts with a photo or a clip. A picture spawns a thousand words.</p>
<p>So that triggers another question: copyright. Were we allowed to forward that viral video? Were we permitted to create and share those memes and parodies?</p>
<p>The answer should lie with our Copyright Act. Yet, that law, enacted in 1987, was born in an era that knew nothing of viral videos, memes or social media. And for decades, Singapore has had to shoehorn real-life situations to fit with our Copyright Act.</p>
<p>But the good news is: an upgrade is available.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) have just released proposals to revamp and overhaul our venerable Copyright Act, to make it fit for a 21st century nation that creates, shares and devours information online. There are a total of 15 proposals which will become law, two of which I will delve into below.</p>
<h3>Credit where credit is due</h3>
<p>Under the existing law, people who create literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works don’t have a right to be identified as the creator. In legal terms, we say that the creator does not have a right of attribution.</p>
<p>That is unsatisfactory. Increasingly, creators and performers want their work to be widely shared and may not even care about receiving royalties each time that happens. But what many of them do care about being recognised for the impact that they make. So, the right of attribution is about valuing recognition, rather than valuing compensation.</p>
<p>The proposal by MinLaw and IPOS gives a right of attribution to two groups of people: extending the existing definition of authors beyond those of books, to include those of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works; and performers of performances.</p>
<p>The proposal makes it clear that “proper attribution helps creators and performers build their reputation and incentivises creation of new works. This is especially important in the digital era, where works are easily misattributed or not attributed at all.”</p>
<p>Once the proposals become law, it will empower authors and performers to be named whenever their works are used, unless they specifically waive that right. This means that creators would receive better protection for their rights here, compared with some other developed countries, including the US, where creators of literary or musical works do not have such rights of attribution.</p>
<h3>Making “fair use” easier</h3>
<p>Forwarding, sharing, reviewing and commenting on stories, pictures and video clips – is that legal, or will that be copyright infringement? Under the Act, we can copy or use copyrighted matter, without the permission of the copyright owner, in limited situations. This is called “fair dealing” or “fair use”.</p>
<p>Copyright is designed to restrict the use of information to allow its owner to exploit his work commercially. But society has always understood that there should be limits to copyright. Artists are inspired by, and build upon, the works of other artists. So, it is important to allow artists to copy a little bit of an existing work, if it means that society will gain by having new creative work. That is the justification for fair use.</p>
<p>An example is Andy Warhol’s artwork, Campbell’s Soup Cans. It is depicts 32 prints of the famous Campbell’s Soup tins. The labels on those tins are copyrighted. Today, Warhol’s groundbreaking pop art style is so universally recognised and lauded that his pieces regularly trade for tens of millions. If society is enriched if artists are given more leeway to express themselves, and that is one justification for the fair use law.</p>
<p>As more of the economy goes tech-based, the fair use exception also allows each successive generation of programmers and entrepreneurs to develop and refine the ideas and products of the previous generation. The graphic user interface that has become ubiquitous today was created by Xerox Parc in the 1970s, refined by Apple in the 1980s and popularised by Microsoft in the 1990s. If people were forced to start from scratch each time a programme is written, 2019’s smartphones may still bear character-based interfaces.</p>
<p>To help determine if something amounts to fair use, the Copyright Act takes into account five factors. These include the purpose and nature of the use of the work, the nature of the work itself, the amount of material to be copied, and the effect of your copying on the work’s value.</p>
<p>Then there is that final factor in our Copyright Act, which has always been controversial. The idea behind it was this: if you could have obtained the right to copy the work within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price, and you didn’t, then it would be hard for you to claim fair use. But in today’s fast-moving world, what would “reasonable time” mean? And who is to say what an “ordinary commercial price” is? The proposal is now to junk this fifth factor, removing a great deal of uncertainty from the process, making the arguments for fair use a lot fairer.</p>
<h3>Reading the proposals</h3>
<p>The Copyright Act is an important piece of legislation that matters to you if you are in the technology industry, or the creative industry, or the news industry, or in academia, or advertising.</p>
<p>Or if you simply use social media. The two proposals I highlighted are particularly relevant, because they make it a little bit easier for us to share and discuss matters, while reminding us to give credit when we use someone else’s work. There are a bunch of other proposals, dealing with a wide range of questions. How long should we protect unpublished works? Can we use works if we do not know who the owner is (we call those “orphan works”)? Should we be allowed to copy works simply for data-mining? Should we make it easier for libraries, museums and archives to copy works? Should we allow people to make and distribute works for print-disabled users, without paying remuneration?</p>
<p>Why so many questions? Our copyright law deals with the stuff of everyday life. In an increasingly interconnected world, where data is the new currency and the rate of creation and innovation is growing explosively, we cannot be held “for hostage” to outmoded intellectual property laws.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many affluent “parents” of “furkids”, it is a familiar routine come Christmas or any other holiday season: stopping by at an expensive boarding facility on the way to the airport to drop off their precious pets, rather than leaving the cute critters home alone.</p>
<p>These days, couples and singles are increasingly choosing to accept furry ones as family instead of, or in addition to, having children. And in tandem with their rising disposable incomes, these animal lovers enjoy the wherewithal to splurge on their pets.</p>
<p>Singapore today boasts at least half a dozen pet hotels that dish out a whole gamut of bespoke luxuries, from aromatherapy sessions and spa treatments to swimming pools and indoor treadmills. This is a burgeoning industry that just a decade or two ago simply did not even exist. Some pet hotels are reputable and possibly worth the cost. But then there are others, like the now infamous Platinium [sic] Dogs Club.</p>
<h3>The curious incident of the dog in the night-time</h3>
<p>Last December, an unsuspecting pet owner paid almost a thousand dollars to check her Shetland Sheepdog into the Club, only to discover, mid-vacation, that the dog had vanished.</p>
<p>The Club’s operator told the canine’s owner that the Sheltie had bolted because the AVA (Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore) had allegedly broken into the Club’s premises illegally, leaving the gates open while the AVA was in operation. Based on this spurious information, the owner rushed back to Singapore and embarked on a wild goose chase, only to discover the horrifying truth: the dog had in fact died while under the Club’s supposed care, and was then summarily and unceremoniously cremated without its owner’s knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>Digging through the paltry information available, one finds that Platinium Dogs Club is in fact an unregistered entity helmed by a lady who ran the pet-boarding facility out of leased premises. Its website, since taken down, touted the company as having “20 years’ of experience” – yet the operator looked no older than her 30s in media photos.</p>
<p>Sure enough, soon after, news reports revealed that several other pet owners had complained of ill-treatment of their animals at the Club, with the death of at least three dogs subsequently confirmed. The AVA and the police are now investigating the Platinium Dogs Club and its operator for several animal welfare offences under the Animals and Birds Act.</p>
<h3>Are our current laws and regulations enough?</h3>
<p>Some background on the Act – it was amended in 2014 to include stiffer penalties for offences, with the view “to take a responsive and preventative approach to animal welfare and nip problems in the bud”.</p>
<p>Now, offenders who are in animal-related businesses will face heftier penalties for animal cruelty: up to S$40,000 in fines or jail not exceeding two years or both for the first offence, and up to S$100,000 in fines or jail not exceeding three years or both for second or subsequent offences. In addition, the Act also prescribes that people working with animals in pet-related businesses be trained in animal care and handling before they can provide such services.</p>
<p>“[T]he amendments are timely, and the updated legislation, backed by rigorous enforcement, will enable us to be better stewards and custodians of our fellow creatures” said proponents of the amendments. All that is well and good, but even if the irresponsible operators are convicted and punished with the maximum fine or even a jail term, is it enough?</p>
<p>Even though animal protection laws in Singapore are already generally ahead of those in the region, we still have some way to go compared with other developed jurisdictions like Switzerland. The European nation actually recognises animals constitutionally, with provisions warranting the protection of the “dignity of the creature” and mandatorily requiring certification of all dog guardians, and even statutorily providing that dogs cannot be left alone for an entire day and must have sufficient contact with humans and where possible other dogs .</p>
<p>There is currently also a seeming gap in Singapore laws on pet-hotels – while the AVA has published a Code for Animal Welfare which sets out minimum standards and best practices for pet boarding businesses, it is not binding as law and a breach of this code does not constitute an offence per se. No licenses seem to be required from the AVA before one can open or operate a pet boarding centre or hotel. All that appears to be required is a license from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), but some establishments don’t have even that.</p>
<h3>Towards enforcing better animal welfare</h3>
<p>So what exactly are the other recourses open to owners whose pets are abused or killed under the supposed care of boarding facilities and the like?</p>
<p>Back in 2014 when the Act was amended, animal activists lobbied for new provisions for emotion-based damages in cases where cruelty leads to injury or death of a pet. It doesn’t take a pet lover to imagine the owner’s distress when a pet is effectively tortured or killed by the negligent or malicious acts of an irresponsible third party, especially where such acts are purely for profit and personal gain. Addressing this distress becomes all the more pertinent with the rising number of people who, for whatever personal reasons, consider their pets as almost equivalent to their children. But the law is still sadly unchanged in this respect.</p>
<p>If the law does not clearly provide for emotion-based damages, then an aggrieved pet owner has two unappealing options: do nothing, or fork out substantial sums to test the issue in Court – with no certainty of outcome, in addition to having to relive the sheer trauma of the torture and killing of the beloved deceased pet at trial.</p>
<p>For practicality’s sake, virtually all owners are reluctantly forced to not act, which perpetuates the vicious cycle; no action in court means no case law to assist the next unwitting owner-victim of wanton irresponsible animal cruelty.</p>
<p>The Platinium Dogs Club case must serve as a timely reminder that current provisions in the Act, though improved, may not serve as sufficient deterrence for some – and more importantly, are cold comfort for the loss of the pet-owner. While no measure of monetary compensation can ever truly fill the void caused by the wrongful death of a pet, statutory damages for such deaths may at least go some way towards showing bereaved owners that the law seeks to provide some small recompense for their impotent fury and raw distress.</p>
<p>A statutory provision for emotion-based damages for the wrongful death of a pet, within prescribed limits, is well worth revisiting and considering. The law already punishes animal cruelty; now let’s do right by the bereaved pet-owners by acknowledging and validating their pain.</p>

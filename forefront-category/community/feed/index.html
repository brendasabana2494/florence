										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2019 has been a rollercoaster ride: Trump accelerates and then suddenly slams on the brakes on his tit-for-tat trade war with China. Hong Kong, hitherto the paradigm of pragmatism, lies smouldering as months of pro-democracy protests see no end. A Swedish girl (celebrating her 17th birthday just last Friday) becomes the unlikely face of environmentalism, shaming Boomers for doing nothing about climate change in front of the UN. The Nobel Prize eludes her but she bags <em>Time Magazine’s</em> Person of the Year instead. Defying odds, Boris Johnson scores a landslide win in the snap elections, possibly paving way to a Brexit that has eluded Britain for months and months.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the real estate market remains languid despite talk of capital flight from the Fragrant to safer harbours, PMDs are all but banned in a flurry of regulations, the Monica Baey sexual misconduct incident sets off a series of Me Too awakenings, POFMA passes into law (goodbye fake news sites?), and the AHTC trial makes a hitherto legalistic term “fiduciary” a household term.</p>
<p>Moving forward into a brave new 2020, in the last Forefront article, our head of IP &amp; TMT Adrian Tan has already predicted that China will issue its own state-backed cryptocurrency in its bid for tighter domestic control and wider world domination.</p>
<p>Here are what the other partners think will happen this year – some predictions being more far-out than others. But if there is anything that the extreme developments of the previous few years have shown, it is that the world has become an increasingly volatile place.</p>
<h3>Thio Shen Yi, SC (Dispute resolution)</h3>
<p>The exuberant march of madness of governments continues. The Representatives impeach Trump and a circus trial follows in the Senate, but not enough Republicans cross the floor to impeach him there as well. Trump therefore hangs onto the Presidency, manages not to start any wars, cold or otherwise, raises more campaign funds than anyone else, and gallops away to win a second term. Chaos ensues, but all the Democrats could do is to contemplate their navels. Four more years of the reality TV presidency. In the UK, Boris forms a government and makes a hard-ish Brexit happen with a border on the Irish Sea. The Scots call a referendum on independence and both sides of the Irish border start talking about invoking the Good Friday Agreement and also calling a referendum for a united Ireland. More chaos, and Boris responds strongly by calling the cries for referendums as “codswallop”. Only 10 per cent of the country understand him.</p>
<h3>Stefanie Yuen Thio (Corporate)</h3>
<p>Hong Kong’s troubles achieve no definitive resolution. No Chinese tanks roll in from Shenzhen, and certainly no concessions will be forthcoming from Beijing. But the windfall that some have predicted for Singapore doesn’t materialise. Rich Chinese will use the perceived opportunity to get the Singapore government to allow them more residential land buying rights, and dangle the carrot of increased investment to try to secure permanent residency. But aside from them parking more funds here, leading to fully sold high end condos that are only one quarter lived in, we will not see an exodus of economic activity from Hong Kong or the Mainland.</p>
<h3>Derek Loh (Construction &amp; Engineering)</h3>
<p>The ability of governments to implement policy, no matter how rational, is increasingly being held hostage by mob rule, challenging the rule of law and even democracy, as manifest in the continued unrest from Lebanon and Chile to Catalonia and Hong Kong, as well as civil disobedience across Western countries. The mainstream media continues to adopt an indulgent attitude towards these events, helping shape public opinion that protests, no matter how unreasonable or violent, are an acceptable alternative to the ballot box.</p>
<h3>Ong Pei Ching (IP &amp; TMT)</h3>
<p>The AI art market will become more established. In 2018, the first AI artwork sold at Christie’s, a portrait of a fictional aristocrat, fetched US$432,500 (S$584,000). This year, cold water was poured on the budding AI art market when Sotheby sold its first AI artwork, a digital show of portraits constantly being generated, for a fraction at US$52,634. However, as AI art moves away from copying human artwork (and portraiture), and starts a new art movement, AI art will become more commercially valuable for reasons other than novelty. The tough legal questions as regards intellectual property of such work may then be tested.</p>
<h3>Ian Lim (Employment &amp; Labour)</h3>
<p>Parliament will consider more comprehensive protection for whistle-blowers in 2020. Singaporeans are already gradually becoming more “woke” about speaking out responsibly to right wrongs, and this development will help Singaporean corporates be better governed and prevent corruption and harassment. Legislation will now need to gather the piecemeal protection presently scattered across various statutes to better protect genuine whistle-blowers from speaking out without fear of reprisal.</p>
<h3>Kelvin Koh (Trusts and Land Disputes)</h3>
<p>The battlefield for tech supremacy shifts to 5G. Facetime fossilises and 3D live-streaming is the new norm. With improved VR systems, we will see a fading gap between face-to-face meetings and virtual 3D engagements. As lawyers embrace the new legal tech, courtroom dramas start to play out in online court rooms with live 3D visuals of the judge and witnesses. Countries vying to be the top arbitration venue will face challenges from servers competing to host the next online arbitration. Singapore will have to rely more on chilli crabs and <em>bak kut teh</em> to draw disputants to resolve disputes physically here instead of logging on to new online arbitration forums. </p>
<h3>Jennifer Chia (Banking &amp; Finance; Corporate Real Estate)</h3>
<p>Everyone expects a real estate supply glut, but here’s a far-out (but far more interesting) prediction: the Singapore government, as part of its election campaign, lowers or abolishes ABSD rates and Trump truly bromances Xi after their trade deal, leading to an uptick to the Singapore property market in 2020. Boomtown Charlie!</p>
<h3>June Ho (Corporate)</h3>
<p>The Council for Board Diversity will gain momentum in connecting stakeholders in order to reach the target for 20 per cent females on all boards in 2020, marking a milestone for female empowerment. More women will be inspired to venture into the boardroom, knowing that they are not just ticking a box. Companies will seek worthy candidates from beyond the usual industries or sectors. Local investors may follow AustraliaSuper’s footsteps, halting investments in companies that lack female board representation. Engagement and support from men lead to increased diversity and inclusion, starting a virtuous cycle, empowering women at all levels at the workplace.</p>
<h3>Kishan Pillay (Construction &amp; Engineering)</h3>
<p>Looking to the skies, the promise of autonomous passenger-carrying drones will remain a blip on the horizon due to prohibitive implementation costs and unresolved safety concerns. But logistics companies may dabble in the technology. Singles Days will not be the same again, with gifts arriving from drone deliveries from sorting stations.</p>
<h3>Chee Chin Wi (Corporate)</h3>
<p>In other news, bubble tea gets served on business class.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past few weeks, I have followed with much interest a Swedish child activist’s barely concealed yearning for the Nobel Peace Prize. Sadly, Greta Thunberg, famous for her tirades on climate change, did not win the award, despite her widely watched zero-emission Atlantic crossing in a hydro- and solar-powered yacht to address the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>Climate change is humanity’s most pressing threat. The Singapore government has, to its credit, made addressing the issue a central policy. So serious is the peril that even the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, was moved to publish an encyclical on climate change, an uncommon event.</p>
<h3>Rising above the tide</h3>
<p>A week ago, I had the pleasure of meeting a university professor who teaches sustainable investing. Hoping to impress, I recited the typical ideas on how we could save the earth. After enduring this for 10 minutes, she looked at me and said in gentle bemusement that much of the messaging shared by the media is “green washing”.</p>
<p>I was rightly rebuked. Our current news cycle obsesses on plastic polluting our oceans, bombarding audiences with all types of climate change advice from avoiding beef to travelling less. Celebrities are jumping onto the bandwagon, including fashion designer Stella McCartney, who startlingly advises that one should not “chuck stuff into a washing machine because it’s been worn”.</p>
<p>But in doing so, the complex environmental discussion has been reduced to soundbites such as “Don’t be a fossil fool” and “Solution Not Pollution”. Superstars exacerbate the problem with their patronising finger-wagging, which provokes counter-accusations of hypocrisy when they fly on private jets to escape the hoi polloi.</p>
<p>This overly simplistic and holier-than-thou approach will undermine climate change’s critical message and create the perception that it is no more than a trivial and irritating complaint. In this cacophony, the real debate that we need to have about climate change is lost.</p>
<p>Three things are distorting a more mature conversation. The noise, such as the hullabaloo over single-use straws, which contribute to just a quarter of one-thousandth of the plastic that flows into the ocean. The vitriol, which draws attention to the messenger rather than the actual issues. And the spectacle, which prioritises optics over action: after Thunberg’s sea crossing, in which she relieved herself in blue plastic buckets, several crew members had to be flown into New York to pilot the vessel back to Europe.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to address how to ameliorate the impact on human lives that result from tackling global warming, so that we are mentally prepared for the price – one that has to be paid by each and every one of us.</p>
<h3>The impacts of climate change action</h3>
<p>In the short term, two important aspects of our existence will be affected: economic health and world peace.</p>
<p>A principal driver of climate change is consumption, be it in the form of beef, clothing, travel, or electronics. If we increase consumption, more carbon enters the atmosphere, placing greater stress on the environment. At the heart of this activity is the use of fossil fuels, whether for fuel or packaging.</p>
<p>So the answer to climate change seems to be simply to consume less and to cease fossil fuel use. Unfortunately, things are not that simple.</p>
<p>Consumption is at the core economic growth and economic strength. The data speaks for itself: consumer spending accounts for 69 per cent of GDP on average in the US, and about 60 per cent for the rest of the world. Should worldwide consumption be reduced by just five percentage points, the world’s GDP would fall by 3 per cent. The corollary is that the world’s economy will likely sink into recession, causing greater suffering for the working masses, which readily manifests itself in public discontent and demonstrations, of late, violent ones.</p>
<p>A prime example are the ongoing protests that have rocked countries such as Chile, Ecuador and Lebanon. These were prompted by unhappiness over matters such as the removal of fuel subsidies, increments in public transport charges, falling income, income inequality and new taxes being foisted on the lower and middle class.</p>
<p>The survival of a politician’s career may hang in the balance. In such circumstances, leaders will be tempted to abandon environmental policies in favour of those that promote economic health. Possibly a bigger threat is a frustrated, struggling electorate supporting politicians who espouse populist, even extremist, ideology.</p>
<p>This is one reason why it is so difficult to have a centrist candidate in the 2020 US Presidential race. On the one hand, we have Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whose green policies include cracking down on fracking and sharply turning away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. This has been seen as very bad news for businesses. On the other extreme is incumbent President Donald Trump, who infamously called climate change a “hoax” and pulled the US out of a global pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions backed by nearly 200 other countries.</p>
<p>Ceasing fossil fuel use is even more complicated, carrying not only economic consequences but also geopolitical ones. A total of 97 countries engage in oil production, many of whom are third world states. The oil and gas drilling sector alone accounts for between two and three per cent of the global economy. The petroleum sector of Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, accounts for 42 per cent of its GDP. Notwithstanding its enormous wealth in natural resources (especially fossil fuels), the unemployment rate in Saudi Arabia is 12.9 per cent and it had a budget deficit of 4.6 per cent in 2018.</p>
<p>The resulting widespread unemployment consequent to the loss of income in countries whose economies are heavily dependent on the production and sale of oil could quickly lead to violent unrest. Significantly, some of the largest oil producers are in the Middle East, one of the most volatile regions in the world. If economic turmoil there from the loss of oil revenues translates into extremism taking hold, then the risk to global security could greatly increase.</p>
<h3>A more mature conversation</h3>
<p>Rather than an extremist and hostile narrative, is there a more measured conversation to be had on climate change?</p>
<p>Singapore’s government has started tackling the problem, first by detailing the steps needed, and then by being transparent about what it’s going to cost – a staggering S$100 billion.</p>
<p>Starting from this year, the Carbon Pricing Act will tax industrial facilities at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emission, a levy set to be doubled or tripled by 2030. The government is also being more selective when allocating land for power-hungry data centres – Singapore being a favourite base for global IT companies – to meet our Paris Agreement commitments. For a state that has always aimed to be business-friendly, these moves signal its willingness to prioritise climate concerns over economic performance.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is making it easier for citizens to do their part in reducing their carbon footprint. By 2030, the MRT network will be extended by 80 per cent to 360 km, making eight out of every 10 homes within 10 minutes’ walk of a station, often with covered walkways sheltering pedestrians all the way in between.</p>
<p>This is a mature approach, quietly reducing emissions without blame-throwing histrionics. Nations and leaders serious about climate change should implement sustainable policies – plans that are both effective and can be rolled out, and thus accepted, gradually. Otherwise, all the impassioned UN speeches will be no more than sound and fury, signifying nothing. And it will be our planet, and our future generations, that will pay the price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[Editor’s note: Last month, our firm was honoured to have won the President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Awards (PVPA) in the Small and Medium Enterprises category. In getting there, we stood on the shoulders of giants – philanthropy leaders and VWOs who gave selflessly of their time and shared their experience to guide us. A big THANK YOU to them all.]</em></p>
<p>A disused runway stacked with crates of bottled water ought to have been a poster child for the efficacy of international aid. Ironically, it illustrated the opposite. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria “like a chainsaw in the sky, one hundred miles wide” made devastating landfall in Puerto Rico. The disaster killed almost 3,000 and left another three million without food and water. International aid was quick to pour in, but to mixed effect.</p>
<p>One year on, that stockpile of life-giving liquid sits untouched, covered with blue tarp shredded by the ravages of time. Information remains scarce as to why exactly the water was not distributed to the hurricane victims, many of whom are today still cut off from utilities. In its place laid plenty of finger pointing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.tsmplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Runway.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Photo credit: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abdiel.santana.5">Abdiel Santana</a> / Facebook </em></p>
<p>This incident does not stand alone. Even the Red Cross has been mired in scandal. After the deadly 2010 Haiti earthquake, it raised almost half a billion dollars in aid, which it claimed had been deployed to help 4.5 million Haitians get “back on their feet” – a figure the country’s ex-prime minister says is inflated. The well-known international aid agency has also been criticised for the large “cut” of donations it levies as administrative fees. But perhaps the most damning statistic is this: the Red Cross says it has provided shelter for more than 130,000 people, but the number of permanent homes built stands at six.</p>
<p>Singapore has suffered our own charity scandals.</p>
<p>In 2005, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) – one of our largest and most-established charities – was rocked by a corporate scandal over donations being used to fund gold-plated faucets and first-class plane tickets for the chief executive. It was further discovered that only ten cents out of every dollar raised were used for dialysis costs.</p>
<p>A few years after that, the much-lauded head of Ren Ci Hospital, the Venerable Shi Ming Yi (best-known for daredevil fundraising stunts where he scaled 20-storey buildings), was found guilty of fraud and misappropriation when he siphoned donations for his personal BMWs, club memberships, global real estate and racehorses.</p>
<h3>Putting the brakes on corporate giving</h3>
<p>Naturally, outrageous wrongdoings like these give even the most well-meaning donors pause for thought. To rectify the situation, the Singapore government imposed more rigorous regulations on charitable organisations. It has also established a class of charities as Institutions of Public Character (IPC) that are subject to stricter monitoring to give donors a greater sense of confidence, and where donations are eligible for tax exemption.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.tsmplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2015.12.15-Muhammadiyah-Welfare-Home-original.jpg" /></p>
<p>While the development is on the right track, it also means that less-established (but just as deserving) causes unable to achieve IPC status will find it even harder to compete for the charity dollar. This is where responsible corporates, armed with a better understanding of the charity landscape than that of the general public, can step in.</p>
<h3>Seek out the “unsexy”</h3>
<p>Because of their visibility, it is tempting to support established charities. NKF was, in its heyday, the best-funded charity with more than S$250 million in reserves. Although every need is equally pressing, there are causes which simply do not enjoy the same level of support; cherubic pre-schoolers who have lost their hair to chemotherapy are easier to raise money for than gangly teens with discipline problems because their parents are in jail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.tsmplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2008.06.21-Boys-Town.jpg" /></p>
<p>Our firm, which shutters our shop front two days a year to organise charity events, has over the years shifted our focus to the latter type of beneficiaries. It felt good to persuade Toys R Us to open an hour early for a Christmas shopping spree for cancer sufferers. However it is our day at Outward Bound School (OBS) with youth-at-risk from a boys’ home that has stuck in our minds: as we yelled out encouragement to the 14-year-old trembling when he attempted to walk a tightrope, we understood that he was not grappling with a fear of heights but facing down the mountains in his life.</p>
<h3>Give the gift of empowerment</h3>
<p>Charity should not be about handouts. It should be about giving the less-fortunate a boost, to help equip and empower them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.tsmplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2011.07.08-Minds-LGS-X-ToTT.jpg" /></p>
<p>After our OBS event, one of our lawyers observed that “if we just give them a handout, no matter how enriching, these boys will always feel like victims”. He hit on the idea of asking the boys from the home to be “Big Brothers” to kids with intellectually disability during a baking class we organised as our next event. We hope that despite the challenging circumstances, they realised that they each have something to offer.</p>
<h3>Multiply your impact</h3>
<p>No matter how good it feels to do something removed from your workaday world, ultimately it is our skill set that enables us to do the most good. Citi, which won this year’s PVPA for Large Enterprises, focuses on imparting financial literacy to the youth. As lawyers, one of the most tangible ways for us to give back is to provide free legal service, and one of the most underserved in our society are our foreign workers. When we volunteer our pro bono hours, we try to take on those cases that have a more far-reaching impact than just the worker whose rights we defend.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.tsmplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2016.11.11-Home-and-TWC2-migrant-workers.jpg" /></p>
<p>TSMP successfully took up the legal cudgels for Hasan Shofiqul, a construction worker whose employer had denied him overtime pay on the basis that his position as foreman made him an “executive” or “manager” under the Employment Act. Mr Hasan, who would work until 3am, return to his dormitory and report back to work three hours later, had a monthly salary of S$2,200. Thankfully, the High Court upheld Mr Hasan’s case and clarified the position, paving the way for other workers to be paid their dues.</p>
<h3>Charity begins at home</h3>
<p>It is one thing to take time off to do some good; more challenging to have to restructure your organisation to empower those with disabilities.</p>
<p>Some months ago, while I was waiting to be admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital for a minor procedure, a young lady appeared, pushing a service cart. She moved slowly, approached each patient systematically and spoke in deliberate tones. She repeated the lines: “Would you like some water? Do you want a biscuit?”</p>
<p>The words were uttered emotionlessly, the water handed out mechanically, but her actions brought a smile to everyone around her. The employee of the hospital has Down syndrome. It was heartwarming to have the burden of the admittance process alleviated, especially by someone with a disability, who was living proof that we all do have something to offer.</p>
<p>CSR has become such an integral KPI for many corporates that fund managers have started peddling “impact investments” for people wanting to invest in businesses that make a difference. We can argue about the efficacy of such funds but one thing is not up for debate: as our country grows in affluence and regional influence, it is our responsibility to use that success and that reach to help the less advantaged.</p>
<p>Or, if I can perch on the shoulders of one more giant, the late Mr Nelson Mandela, whose words on these were:</p>
<p>“A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On September 5, the New York Times (NYT) published an anonymous op-ed essay by a “senior official in the Trump administration”, claiming that White House staffers are “working diligently from within to frustrate” parts of the US President’s agenda. The explosive article labels Trump amoral, his impulses “anti-democratic” and his leadership style “petty and ineffective”. The NYT explained that it had taken the extraordinary step of withholding the writer’s identity so as to protect his or her job, and that this “is the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers”.</p>
<p>President Trump called the action “gutless”.</p>
<p>The moral hazard of publishing the damning expose without naming the writer is clear: how do we judge its authenticity if we didn’t know who wrote it? The anonymity feeds Trump’s claims that his detractors in the media are creating “fake news”. But this is the NYT, whose journalistic integrity is widely acknowledged, and so the piece retains credibility.</p>
<h3>The resuscitation of news organisations</h3>
<p>This journalistic credibility, possessed by the NYT and a few other international papers, is the envy of many others. It is what makes their commentary so damaging to world leaders and corporate bigwigs found in their crosshairs. So it is interesting that over the last five years, a number of well-respected news publications have been acquired by those who inhabit their front pages.</p>
<p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought the ailing Washington Post in 2013 for US$250 million and has expanded the news and tech teams, returning the 140-year-old paper back to profitability. In 2015, Japan’s Nikkei acquired the Financial Times (FT). More recently Alibaba Group purchased South China Morning Post (SCMP) and has since gone on a hiring spree, with the Chinese tech giant said to be willing to lose money on the unprofitable but influential Hong Kong newspaper.</p>
<p>Bezos has reportedly not tried to influence his new publication, but the reality is that a tech giant now controls one of the US’s most reputable news outlets. The FT’s continued journalistic independence was also questioned, its new owner being what one commentator calls the “corporate voicepiece of Japan”. The SCMP has been accused of “pioneering a new form of propaganda” under Jack Ma’s leadership, because it is seen to be shying away from investigative reporting on Communist Party leaders and hot potato topics like human rights.</p>
<p>While corporate investments by white knight investors may be what news outlets, facing the existential threat posed by the Internet, need to fight declining circulation and disappearing ad revenues, recall that the Fourth Estate – an independent and responsible press – arose as a check and balance on unbridled power.</p>
<p>The provision of responsibly sourced news and honest commentary without fear and without favour – coincidentally, one of the FT’s taglines – is necessary for efficient operation of democracies and markets. If news outlets are influenced by organisations with their own business and political agendas, whether this influence is in fact exercised, public trust will be eroded.</p>
<h3>The scourge of fake news</h3>
<p>Into this disrupted newsroom walks Fake News.</p>
<p>The Internet provides a protective cloak of anonymity. Damaging and inflammatory views can circumnavigate the globe before they are fact checked, with potentially disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Russian elements are said to have influenced the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential elections, which saw Trump installed in the White House, through illegal information warfare. Facebook admits that its platform had disseminated posts created by Russian-linked fake accounts to more than 126 million Americans.</p>
<p>Singapore is understandably anxious about the impact of foreign influence and fabricated news on our shores. Earlier this year, Parliament established a Select Committee to look into the issue of deliberate online falsehoods, and is expected to adopt laws to combat this<a name="_ednref1"></a><a href="#_edn1">[*]</a>. The problem is, any such laws could be double-edged swords – they can maintain the integrity of the news or, in the wrong hands, be used to quash dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>Malaysia’s ex-Prime Minister, Najib Razak, who was spectacularly unseated in a shock election defeat and is currently facing charges of money laundering, passed controversial anti-fake news laws that many felt were aimed at stifling dissent. These have since been repealed by his successor, Tun Mahathir Mohamad, one of the first people investigated under the statute. Similar laws have been deployed in Egypt, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, none known for their democratic freedoms.  </p>
<p>This begs the question, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (“Who will guard the guards themselves?”)</p>
<h3>An objective and independent press – a public good</h3>
<p>The battle against fake news needs to be fought on two fronts.</p>
<p>First, we should certainly toughen our legislation against those who spread it. The dissemination of misleading information in stock markets is already a securities offence. Purveyors of fake news with even more potentially adverse consequences – whether relating to the outcome of elections, public order or even defamation of a private person – should be punished. But to dispel the fear of such laws being used to further partisan objectives, enforcement could be put in the hands in an independent body, made up of individuals of international repute and integrity, rather than pure government appointees.</p>
<p>More importantly, we need to re-arm our news media.</p>
<p>Our national newssheets battle with a failing business model. They are further handicapped by the impression of government influence or a suspicion of self-censorship. The less we trust our local newspapers, the less we rely on them, which exacerbates the vicious circle of declining circulation and insufficient resources to produce in-depth commentary. This serves no one, including the government, especially if Singaporeans start turning to foreign press and dubious blogs for news and commentary.</p>
<p>To be a developed democracy and a mature financial centre, Singapore needs responsible publications to be honest brokers of news and intelligent providers of commentary.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to restructure ownership of our national newspapers, currently owned by a listed company and subject to the demands of shareholder returns. Newspaper ownership could be privatised into an independent foundation and funded by public money. If independent news reporting and, more importantly, intelligent commentary, are seen as a public good, we should pay for that, much like we pay for well-maintained public highways and street lights, even on roads we never travel.</p>
<p>That will make each Singaporean a real stakeholder in real news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A secretly, stupendously rich man falls in love with a poor girl. His mother declares her a gold-digger. Much gnashing of teeth ensues. Beyond its simple romcom plot, however, the film <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> has a less palatable aspect to its story: inequality and our apparent acceptance of it. For all the indigestible wealth on awkward display, the film attracted much praise and positive interest from critics and audiences alike, despite it being so far removed from the hoi polloi.</p>
<p>As far back as October 2013, then-US President Barack Obama called rising inequality and the lack of upward mobility in society “the defining challenge of our time”. More recently, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was even blunter in a Parliamentary speech. “We must discourage people from flaunting their social advantages,” he said. “We should frown upon those who go for ostentatious displays of wealth and status, or worse, look down on others less well-off and privileged.”</p>
<p>Social imbalance and inequality is a problem that continues to plague human society in the 21st century. And the gulf between the haves and have-nots cannot be starker than in Asia. According to a BBC news article, the Asia-Pacific is now home to the greatest number of millionaires and billionaires in the world, yet it also hosts about two-thirds of the global working poor. The region’s income Gini coefficient, a number that measures inequality from 0 (most equal) to 1 (most unequal), rose from 0.37 to 0.48 between 1990 and 2014. In 2017, 79 per cent of the wealth created in China went to its one-percenters, who now hold almost half of the country’s accumulated wealth.</p>
<h3>The “struggle” against inequality</h3>
<p>The bedevilment of inequality manifests itself in today’s intellectual heroes and political rock stars. A mere 25 years ago, Thomas Piketty and his book <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> would have been branded “communist” for recommending that governments adopt a global tax on wealth – to prevent soaring inequality contributing to economic or political instability – and banned in many a country. Similarly, just 15 years ago Bernie Sanders’ socialist election platform would not have posed a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton&#8217;s candidacy.</p>
<p>Instead, Piketty has been anointed to celebrity status and politicians railing against social inequality are lauded as progressive. Income inequality is no longer a tired shibboleth trotted out by hippy socialists. That is because ever-increasing inequality has fostered a greater distrust of politicians, governments and corporate leaders, whose promises of better times ahead seem never to materialise. In extreme cases, this has resulted in populism and the embracing of demagogues.</p>
<p>1,888 years ago, Roman Emperors kept the common people in check by providing entertainment in the form of gladiatorial contests and chariot races, and distributing free bread. The option of hurling loaves into the heaving masses is, however, no longer an option for the governing class. So in its place, politicians feed the voting public a diet of commitments to affordable medical care, housing and education, assuring them of rising incomes and “decent paying jobs” for the “middle class”.</p>
<h3>The other side of the coin</h3>
<p>One would have thought that amid all of this hand-wringing about inequality, humans would naturally reject measures or initiatives that derogate from the fundamental principle of egalitarianism. There is evidence to suggest the contrary.</p>
<p>The economies of some of the most enlightened and democratic countries appear to have little difficulty introducing systems that are specifically designed to be unequal. Take, for instance, dual class shares, in which holders of a special class of shares have a larger number of votes per share. All the major stock exchanges embrace dual class shares as a necessary component of the market. No politician in a democratically elected government of today would dare to suggest such a system of electoral voting; yet a clearly differentiated and class based voting system is seen as defensible, even justifiable, in profit-driven companies.</p>
<p>In our modern age where governments struggle to control information circulation and sharing, almost a quarter of the world’s population live under an authoritarian regime, absolute monarch, or military government without even the basic right to vote. Significantly, a good majority of this 25 per cent exhibits little overt ambition to change the status quo. Another 12 per cent of the people in the world continue to accept the imposition of a caste system. Unsurprisingly many of the countries where these occur have very high levels of income inequality.</p>
<p>The issue does not seem to be one of simple indifference. On the contrary our species seems to have an unhealthy, almost primordial, attraction to inequality and celebrating it. Like the proverbial moth drawn to fire, our modern and informed society seems entranced with enshrining differentiations, class and inequality, or at least not wrestling against it. Think about the success of <em>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</em>, <em>Real Housewives of New York</em>, and the constant fascination with toppled politicians&#8217; wives and their treasure troves of luxury goodies.</p>
<p>Perhaps Pope Francis expressed it best in his apostolic exhortation “<em>Evangelii Gaudium</em>” when he wrote: “How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?”</p>
<p>All may not be lost. That the conversation about inequality continues and occupies such a significant part of our current narrative is a sure sign that the issue remains in focus. Maybe our present day obsession with how the one-percenters live, fed by constant internet updates, and the constant refrain about inequality will ultimately see lasting adjustments to society that allow the “Top One” to co-exist peacefully with the middle class without any significant ructions. One can always be hopeful. After all Rachel and Nick did get engaged in <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the Trump-Kim Summit has successfully concluded in Singapore, with the Leader of the Free World shaking hands with the Supreme Leader of one of its most coldblooded dictatorships.</p>
<p>Looking at these two scions of privilege, it is hard not to be struck by how much they have in common, united not just by their comically bad hair, but also by their low regard for women. President Trump has famously bragged that he could get away with routinely grabbing women by their private parts. Chairman Kim is reported to have ordered his government to scour the countryside, sourcing for a “pleasure troupe” of girls as young as 13 or 14 years old, to serve as his entertainers and concubines. The women are eventually passed around to high-ranking officials when, in their mid-twenties, they are deemed over the hill. </p>
<h3>Strides of progress</h3>
<p>Seeing these two infamous misogynists feted on the world stage is cause for pensive irony.</p>
<p>The last 18 months have been marked by some great strides for women. It started with the “Women’s March on Washington”, which saw more than two million people flooding the streets of US cities to protest the inauguration of President Trump. Then came exposes of sexual harassment in high-profile companies, notably Uber, whose high-flying CEO, Travis Kalanick, was sacked, all but in name, for various corporate and management scandals.</p>
<p>There followed the #MeToo movement, when victims of sexual harassment spoke up. The momentum toppled powerful movie producers and newscasters, A-list star Kevin Spacey, and most recently, the co-founder of Guess. For their wide and strong impact on the contemporary milieu, <em>Time </em>magazine named “The Silence Breakers”, those men and women who have spoken out against sexual harassment and assault, as its 2017 Person of the Year.</p>
<p>But the backlash has already started against the movement of female empowerment. What is surprising is that this pushback is coming from women themselves. One fear is that if men had to tiptoe around their female colleagues, decreased opportunities for women in the workplace will follow. It is a legitimate concern. If women are seen as a victimised class for whom special protections are needed, the gender equality that the women’s liberation movement has worked so hard to achieve will be eroded.</p>
<p>As a woman, I just want to work in an environment that is blind to my gender.</p>
<p>Singaporean women are blessed to work in a country where blatant sexual discrimination and harassment are, at least anecdotally, rare. That said, our continued abysmal progress in achieving gender equality in the boardroom tells its own story – we still have a long journey ahead of us.</p>
<h3>Call out casual sexism each time, every time</h3>
<p>Two thoughts on this:</p>
<p>First, we should consistently and fearlessly call out instances of gender bias that exhibit genuine sexism, whether or not it is directed at you, and even where the act is unconscious.</p>
<p>A recent meeting I attended, where a senior business leader made a joke about the arbitrariness of thresholds in corporate governance, nails this point. He had likened it to “sex with an underaged girl”.</p>
<p>“If it’s her 16th birthday,” he mused, “her boyfriend can have sex with her legally, but sex the day before is a crime.”</p>
<p>My objection to this inappropriate comment was met with a brush off, but another male attendee apologised to the ladies at the end of the meeting. I appreciated that but it was an apology that could have been directed to every person in the room, because sexism lessens us all.</p>
<p>Women sometimes feel obliged to tolerate sexist comments poorly wrapped in a veneer of humour so that we do not come across as prim or thin skinned. But inaction in the face of even casual sexism can engender a more general prejudice. Like pornography, watch enough of it and you risk becoming inured to the objectification of women and the consumerisation of sex.</p>
<h3>But let cool heads prevail</h3>
<p>This leads me to my second point, which will seem diametrically opposed to the first: political correctness can go too far.</p>
<p>There is a move in the west to turn the workplace into a bastion of chillingly appropriate behaviour. Lucy Kellaway, writing in the <em>Financial Times</em>, says that men shouldn’t compliment their female coworkers on their looks.</p>
<p>“A comment from a man about a woman’s appearance is usually due to one of three things”, she argues: lechery, gallantry (which she feels does not sit well with corporate manners) or awkwardness (because “men don&#8217;t know what to say to their professional female colleagues and gormlessly admire their wardrobes”).</p>
<p>While I agree that commenting on a woman’s appearance can be an act of sexual harassment, it could very well just be a friendly gesture. It humanises the workplace, making us more than just digits of production. Ms Kellaway would surely not approve of my assistant, who prefers to be affectionately called 美女 (mei nü or beautiful girl), responding best when she is objectified by her looks.</p>
<p>With no hard and fast rules, one needs to be sensible about whether words or actions amount to harassment. They must ultimately come down to intent, and have to be taken in context. A boss praising you and telling you he is recommending you for promotion, before inviting you out for a drink after work may be saying uncontroversial things, but the sub-text is potentially nefarious.</p>
<p>Contrast this to a workplace that abounds with seemingly inappropriate dialogue. Like this comment between two colleagues alone in a corner office: “You look hot in that top… why don’t you take it off?” A passer-by might do a double take at the seemingly suggestive comment. As it turns out, it was my female associate suggesting that I was sweltering in my jacket. So I took it off.</p>
<p>Did we feel harassed that day? Yes, but only because of a looming client deadline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While “leafing” – or should I instead say “scrolling” in today’s need to sound tech savvy – through the news websites, the two subjects seemed to have captured the media’s attention: immigration and plastic. The immigration debate has been going on for some time and has been argued and declaimed from all perspectives. But the hyperbolic animadversions to plastic is a more recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>On 1 January 2018, China, the world’s biggest recycler of scrap plastic, stopped importing the waste material. The impact rippled around the world. The United Kingdom alone made three major announcements on plastics in the year’s first fortnight: on 9 January, manufacturers across the nation could no longer use plastic microbeads, and products containing this material cannot be sold from July; two days later, the Scottish government shared its plans to ban plastic cotton buds; on the 16th, one of the country’s largest supermarket chains pledged to eliminate plastic packaging from all of its own-brand products by end 2023. When seen in the context of China’s decision, this frenetic activity is hardly surprising – after all, the People’s Republic handled two-thirds of Britain’s used plastics.<br />
 <br />
It was all very arresting. However, all this angst and handwringing about plastics (and immigration) really is only addressing the symptoms and ignoring the root cause. We all know what the elephant in the room is: there are simply too many people in the world.</p>
<h3>The great population explosion</h3>
<p>In 1901, the global population was 1.6 billion. Today, it is approximately 7.6 billion. In 117 years we human beings have more than quadrupled our numbers, despite two World Wars, numerous famines, shockingly shameful genocides and a “Great Leap Forward”. At our current breakneck growth rate, we add approximately one billion persons to the Earth every 13 years. In the meantime, the human lifespan is ever lengthening with the rapid advancement and development in medical treatment. It won’t be long before cancer loses its reputation as a death sentence.</p>
<p>In 2011, the UN published a comprehensive report saying that the world population growth rate must slow down significantly to avoid reaching unsustainable levels. The great Naturalist Sir David Attenborough has weighed in on this issue on a number of occasions: “… the Earth is finite and you can’t put infinity into something that is finite. So if we don’t do something about it then the world will do something about it – the natural world that is – we will starve.”</p>
<p>In another interview he added: “… what are all these famines in Ethiopia, what are they about? They’re about too many people for too little pieces of land. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.”</p>
<p>An average human produces a kilogramme of carbon dioxide every single day by the simple act of breathing. If the world population increases by a billion, an extra 365 million tons of CO2 is released into the atmosphere every year. And we have not begun to even look at the plastic consumption! In the face of all of this, humanity (including society and policy makers) has simply shrugged its shoulders and uttered a collective “meh!”</p>
<h3>Population growth = economic growth?</h3>
<p>China, which for decades had an obsessive fear about a population explosion, and which was the only major country to have an official population reduction policy, ended its one-child rule in 2015, 35 years after it was introduced. The rationale for this reversal was a concern that its population was rapidly greying and that economic growth would be affected.<br />
 <br />
Policy makers and economists seem to be fixated, if not obsessed, with “greying populations” and “fertility rates”. It has become a constant refrain, to the extent that population growth has become a canon in the religion of economic growth and human development. Is it true that a greying population will inexorably lead to an inevitable dizzying downward spiral of a country’s economy or social implosion?<br />
 <br />
There is a real life example to hand – Japan. What is occurring here seems to run counter to these doomsday prophesies. Yes, its population is contracting rapidly. Yes, its economy is sluggish if not stagnant. Yet its standard of living remains one of the highest in the globe and its economy remains one of the largest. Recently the Japanese economy has even started to stir. I am no expert but perhaps we should re-consider the economic hypothesis of “grey is bad” being accepted as a universal truth.<br />
 <br />
As if the economic argument for population expansion simpliciter is not sufficiently damaging, we also have the societal and cultural contribution to population growth. Recently the Indian government estimated that the desire among the country’s parents to have sons instead of daughters has created 21 million “unwanted” girls, thanks to couples reproducing until they had a boy. To give the issue some perspective – there are about 140 countries with a population of less than 21 million, including Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Greece.<br />
 <br />
The other major (and obvious) effect of the population explosion we are witnessing is the huge migration of people from poorer countries and regions to wealthier ones. It is not my intention to enter into a discourse on this topic as it has already been debated at many levels and in many mediums. Suffice it to say that the rise in, and growing acceptability of, extreme political parties is an irrefutable direct consequence of this wave of human migration.<br />
 <br />
The world’s press and governments keep baying on about climate change and greenhouse gases and braying about Mr Trump’s refusal to accede to the Paris Agreement, but it seems that the very cause of the problem, the unbridled population explosion, just doesn’t seem to feature or fall to be considered.</p>
<h3>The need to change direction</h3>
<p>The penny appears to have dropped for some. Moderate countries are beginning to recognise the crux of the issue. In a speech on 11 July 2017, Denmark’s Minister for Development Co-operation pledged more funds for family planning in developing nations saying that this could help “limit the migration pressure on Europe”. While such developments are positive, they remain insignificant compared to the magnitude of the problem.<br />
 <br />
Which brings us back to the title of this piece. By 31 December 2018, listed companies in Singapore are obliged to issue their first sustainability report, which “should set out the issuer’s policies, practices and performance in relation to the material ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] factors identified, providing descriptive and quantitative information on each of the identified material ESG factors for the reporting period”. Perhaps the more enlightened listed companies will identify population growth control as part of its “policies, practices and performance” on sustainability and perhaps the Singapore Exchange may even accept this as part of a report. Personally I doubt it.<br />
 <br />
Back to the old tried and tested method – it is about time every couple in the world capable of reproducing acquired a television set. Or, again in the interest of sounding tech savvy, two personal tablets coupled with subscriptions to Netflix (chill specifically excluded).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, Americans installed a reality TV star in the White House who doesn’t seem to let the facts get in the way of a good tweet. Trump’s shambolic management style has given America’s enemies a perceived opportunity to drive their country’s agendas. Not long after the last new year firework had disappeared into a wisp of smoke into the Pyongyang sky, Kim Jong Un announced that North Korea’s nuclear missiles are now able to strike US soil. “The button for nuclear weapons,” said the North Korean dictator, “is on my table.”<br />
  <br />
 And how did the leader of the free world respond? By Twitter, of course, boasting that his nuclear button is “much bigger &amp; more powerful”.<br />
  <br />
 It is surreal, not only that the fate of humanity hangs in the balance of what resembles a schoolboys’ pissing match, but that we – the US and the rest of world not under the despotic thumb of a dictator – aren’t doing more about it. Maybe it is the belief that the verbal one-upmanship will not result in actual war: that Pyongyang’s claims of nuclear ability are overblown (excuse the bad pun), and that, push coming to actual shove, there are sufficient checks and balances in the US system to prevent Trump from starting an apocalypse.<br />
  <br />
 Or maybe the more immediate threat of global conflict comes from elsewhere.</p>
<h3>The Trojan Horse</h3>
<p>First, let’s go back 2,500 years. The Trojan Horse was a large wooden horse built by the Greeks and left outside the walls of Troy during the war between their two kingdoms. The Greeks appeared to retreat, and the Trojans wheeled the horse into their city as a trophy, only to have the soldiers hidden inside open the gates to the victorious Greeks. From this story came Virgil’s phrase “Beware of Greeks bearing gifts”, as well as the label that now describes computer malware disguised as legitimate software.</p>
<p>Technology and the Internet have been a boon to the masses, giving access to information and education, helping to level the playing field between rich and poor, and between advanced and underdeveloped countries. It has made life more convenient, improved individual wellbeing and enhanced community engagement.</p>
<h3>CyberWar</h3>
<p>But for all its benefits, tech has introduced its own malware into society. The Internet, like any global city, has some murky back alleys. The Dark Web and the untraceability of cryptocurrency facilitate illegal activities, from drug deals to terrorism financing. In a 2017 report, Nato highlighted that access to technology and the global nature of cyberspace would help terrorist networks expand, challenging the current near-monopoly that state actors have on high-tech weapons. </p>
<p>If World War I was started when a gunshot rang out in Sarajevo, and World War II was characterised by wailing air raid sirens, the next global conflict is likely to be launched with a quiet click of a mouse. In a cyberattack, enemy-sponsored hackers could jam defence systems, disrupt key installations, and stall critical facilities. Impromptu auditions have already been held: in 2017, the ransomware WannaCry claimed as its largest victim the UK’s National Health Service, shutting down everything from MRI scanners to blood-storage refrigerators.</p>
<p>There is speculation that governments are pouring resources into state-sponsored hacking. Russia’s hacker army, thought to be 1,000 strong, enjoys an annual budget of US$300 million. China is rumoured to have a hacker army of 50,000 but has consistently denied this. Bloomberg estimates that North Korea employs 1,700 hackers, backed by 5,000 support staff. However, Reuters reports that it is the US that is the world’s most aggressive nation when it comes to cyberspying and cyberwarfare. At home, Singapore’s military is building a specialised core of cyber defenders, a “White Hat” SEAL team if you will, to protect the nation from cyberwarfare.</p>
<h3>The scourge of fake news</h3>
<p>In a democracy, transparency of information is the lifeblood of free elections. He who informs (or misinforms) the electorate can influence the outcome of the election.</p>
<p>According to a Stanford University study, fake news websites received 159 million visits during the last month of the 2016 US election. Other research states that the most widely shared news stories during the election were fake. Facebook believes 120 fake Russian-backed pages created 80,000 posts that were received by 29 million Americans directly, and far more through sharing of the posts. If, as is believed, the majority of this misinformation was pro-Trump, how much did this fake content influence the outcome of the election?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Singapore has expressed concerns about fake news. A Select Committee of Parliament has been formed, with legislation to follow. But even a hint of media control by the authorities will have the civil rights community up in arms. In combating inaccurate news reports with regulation, the government could de-legitimise news media by the perception of editorial influence. When the authorities clash with fake news, the public will be the losers.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a couple of recent developments could have far-reaching effects which have not yet entered our collective consciousness.</p>
<h3>Changes in Facebook’s News Feed protocol</h3>
<p>Facebook has announced changes to its News Feed algorithm to prioritise content from friends and family, over posts from businesses and news media, explaining that more personal interaction enhances users’ welfare. The upshot of this is that your Facebook feed will show limited updates from news outlets.</p>
<p>Whether you believe that the social media giant’s latest move is prompted by altruism or a more calculated profit motive, or even a desire to pre-empt regulation, what is clear is that this change will result in an echo chamber that is both larger and louder. The user’s own thoughts and opinions will be reinforced by self-selection, as we are more likely to interact with like-minded connections, which will in turn cause Facebook to push more of such similar opinions to our news feed. Our society’s social, political and economic fault lines will be deepened.</p>
<p>If we used social media only to view friends’ travel photos and indulge in their food porn, Facebook’s new policy would not matter. But with an increasing proportion of our news coming from online content (as the decline of printed news indicates), and our opinions inevitably shaped by commentary received from platforms where we spend the most time, Facebook and sites like it will have an outsized impact on how we view global developments. Add to this the rise of fake news, and you have a potentially dangerous combination.</p>
<h3>Net neutrality</h3>
<p>Another thing that has largely escaped our radar: the US Federal Communications Commission announced in 2017 the repeal of the US’s net neutrality policy. This is the principle that Internet service providers must treat all data on the internet equally, and not discriminate against type of content and user. Without this, they could block content, and slow down, restrict or deny access to sites, selectively. Theoretically, a loss of net neutrality could allow those with deeper pockets to influence public perception and opinion, and silence the marginalised and minorities.</p>
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>Citizens of a modern democracy must have access to accurate news and independent commentary from credible media sources to help them make informed voting choices. Anything that reinforces bias or allows those with greater financial resources and an agenda, to influence the electorate’s views, would be a threat to that freedom. If the information we receive is being filtered or controlled in ways we are not aware of – whether by the net neutrality policies of ISPs or the algorithms of search and social media platforms – then our decisions are being influenced without our knowledge. Tech giants like Facebook and Google, who control arguably the most important commodity in the Internet age – information – have the ability to shape the world. There’s no guarantee that they will do so for the better.</p>
<p>Tech has invaded our lives with the promise of a better lifestyle, and on this it has largely delivered. While we have knowingly relied on its conveniences, it is our unwitting submission to its influences that poses the threat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Heroes Among Us</h3>
<p>Singapore received an early National Day present 2 weeks ago. It’s not another report on our students&#8217; top scores in the latest PISA study, or about our local universities&#8217; rising rankings against renowned institutions internationally. Neither is it to do with our world’s best airport (5 years in a row at last count), or how our national carrier maintains its iconic status amidst a slew of gulf bankrolled upstarts – the Manchester Cities of the aviation premier league if you will. No.</p>
<p>Rather, the good news is that our own home-grown (albeit Malaysian born) graphic novelist, Sonny Liew, has won Singapore&#8217;s first ever Eisner Award, dubbed the ‘Oscars of Comics’, at San Diego Comic-Con on 22 July 2017. In fact, Liew swept 3 Eisner Awards, for his graphic novel-cum-political commentary &#8211; The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye. Shortly before the book&#8217;s release in Singapore, the National Arts Council withdrew its cash grant for the title, citing &#8220;sensitive content&#8221; and its potential to &#8220;undermine the authority and legitimacy&#8221; of the government. The work became the best-selling local fiction title that year, making it to the bestseller lists at Amazon and The New York Times when it was published in the United States.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the National Arts Council congratulated Liew on his awards on its Facebook page on 24 July 2017, WITHOUT naming the work.</p>
<p>But this is not a discussion of lofty values like the sanctity of artistic expression, or whether political sensitivity is a valid criterion in the allocation of public funds. Instead, it begs the question: How do we identify our national heroes, and should we aspire that our sons and daughters be Sonny Liews?</p>

<h3>Schooling a Nation of Heroes</h3>
<p>Speaking of national heroes, the same weekend brought news that bona fide national hero Joseph Schooling had broken his own Asian record in the men’s 50m butterfly enroute to the final at the FINA World Championships in Budapest. No doubt, if he had won gold at the World Championships, we would have allocated a First Class seat on our iconic airline and rolled out the red carpet at our world’s best airport to welcome him home. And why not? His achievements are to be celebrated, a just reward for years of hard work, dedication and commitment. More pertinently, Jo Schooling, like so many other athletes before him, is worthy of being a national hero, embodying values that we collectively agree we should all aspire to.</p>
<p>For the better part of the last 50 years, we have caned, chided, and more recently cajoled our children to study hard to earn a place in prestigious universities, and better still on coveted government scholarships, because they represented the values that we hold dear – meritocracy and equal opportunities based on academic ability and effort. Those who succeeded were held up as examples because they represented attainable goals that every Singaporean had a fair chance of aiming for.</p>
<p>Sporting heroes were also uncontentious. We have always applauded our sporting heroes, especially those who succeeded beyond our shores: Tan Howe Liang, Ang Peng Siong, Fandi Ahmad. We claimed them as our own, shining a spotlight on our little red dot, and basked in their reflected glory. We admired these heroes but perhaps did not quite want our children to be like them. It is only in recent times that we have started viewing them as viable role models for our children. Jo Schooling has done this – it is now ok for our kids to put their time and energy into sport, on par with, if not at the expense of their education.</p>
<h3>A path less travelled</h3>
<p>As our nation prepares to celebrate its 52nd birthday, it’s as good a time as any to reflect on who we want to celebrate as heroes, who will inspire us as a nation. When Singapore turned 50, there was too much buzz around our golden jubilee – more about celebrating our past than pausing to ponder our future. Turning 51 was a relative downer – the after-party that had gone on for too long whilst still nursing a hangover from the past year’s excesses. So, reflection at 52 is apt – with middle age comes maturity, choice of heroes included.</p>
<p>What’s so special about Sonny Liew? We’ve celebrated artists, musicians, writers before; even actors who’ve graduated from local TV to minor speaking parts in Hollywood blockbusters. What&#8217;s more, the virtuosity of Liew&#8217;s work is not immediately obvious. A heartland auntie is just as likely to call his work a comic than a work of art (not that the 2 are mutually exclusive).</p>
<p>Sonny Liew does not fit comfortably into our pantheon of heroes because his achievement is in a less mainstream discipline. As Singapore slides into middle age, I would like to think that he serves as a subtle reminder that a part of the process of maturing as a nation includes re-examining the criteria by which we choose our heroes. Do we only immortalize those whose successes we wish to share by association? Or should our heroes reflect our changing aspirations, that we would encourage our children to follow in their path? If the latter, then we must ask ourselves if we are ready to embrace less mainstream pathways, not just as the purview of outliers like Liew, but as a worthy pursuit by all, with the encouragement of the establishment.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect a flood of parents encouraging their doodling offspring to put “graphic novelist” in their next term essay on what they want to be when they grow up. For now, let us pause a moment and applaud Sonny Liew, not just for winning an international award, not even for doing something that no Singaporean has previously done, ever; but for letting us know that there are other pathways of aspiration and achievement.</p>
<p>As a post-script, it is also heartening that the NAC has extended its congratulations to Sonny Liew. While we may not all agree on whether his grant should have been withdrawn, there is at least no quarrel that his awards should be celebrated.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Sonny Liew. And thank you for Singapore&#8217;s early birthday present. We celebrate your work, even if it remains unnamed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>&#8220;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&#8221;</h3>
<p>Charles Dickens was writing about the French Revolution, but his words echo equally on the Female Revolution today.</p>
<p>The good news: There is an unprecedented number of women in high profile government roles. Germany, Britain, Scotland and soon, it is hoped, the US, have female leaders. Closer to home, both Taiwan and South Korea have women presidents, although the latter is currently embroiled in a scandal involving a close adviser and a religious cult. Women also have a large part to play in steering the global economy – the heads of the US Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund both have double X chromosomes. Even Singapore is basking in the sunlight of gender progression. We were ranked top Asian country for gender equality by the United Nations. Further, if rumours are to be believed, our next head of state may be a woman (you read this here first!).</p>
<p>The bad news: Well, Trump, and all he stands for in women&#8217;s rights. Hard to believe that the Republican nominee for US President, the most powerful position in the world, is a man who mouthed &#8220;You know I&#8217;m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It&#8217;s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don&#8217;t even wait. And when you&#8217;re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The US elections are a stark reminder that gender equality cannot be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s percentage of women on boards continues to be a laughable 7.3%. Many organisations have embraced the cause and implemented policies to help women in leadership. But, as the Harvard Business Review[1] reports, organisations &#8220;don&#8217;t address the often fragile process of coming to see oneself, and to be seen by others, as a leader&#8221;.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that practices that have worked successfully for men, do not translate well for a woman. For example, we&#8217;ve been told to ride on the coattails of a more senior executive in order to rise in the corporation. But show me a woman who latches on to a male superior, and I&#8217;ll show you a broad whom colleagues will accuse of sleeping her way to the top.</p>
<p>Another problem we need to recognize is that women are often our own worst enemy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s imperative, therefore, for women to take the problem into their own hands. In addition to relying on flexible hours and equipping programmes, we should address the mindset defaults that are holding us back in our journey to female empowerment.</p>
<p>Some suggestions from a fellow traveler.</p>
<h3>Start Saying Yes</h3>
<p>In my two decades in management, I&#8217;ve observed that women tend to be motivated by a fear of letting others down, while men are more focused on the win. Obviously this is a gross over-generalisation, but it could explain why women are more risk adverse, and less willing to volunteer for tasks that lead to promotion, than men. Women also get upset when brash male self-confidence is recognized, while their quiet contributions are seemingly overlooked.</p>
<p>If this is true, then women have to stop expecting to be promoted to positions that we do not have the confidence to undertake. Because when thrown into a role, more often than not, women will just get on with it. Look at motherhood – the ultimate example of charging into the unknown filled with dangers and risks.</p>
<p>So, put up your hands, ladies. You&#8217;ve Got This.</p>
<h3>Stop Beating Yourself Up</h3>
<p>May I suggest that women tend to carry the weight of failure badly and for too long?</p>
<p>Too many women feel defined by their mistakes and go into a tailspin of self-loathing and doubt.</p>
<p>A top female partner in an international firm told me how a small error plagued her the whole day. She would replay the misstep over and over in her head, even finding it hard to make eye contact with colleagues in the aftermath.</p>
<p>We need to stop magnifying our shortcomings in our heads. Yes, it shouldn&#8217;t have happened. But how big a mistake was it, and what does this mean for your career? This is a harder question to tackle, but a much more valuable exercise than mental self-flagellation.</p>
<h3>Use Your Attributes</h3>
<p>Women who say it&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world and that we need to beat men at their own game, are missing out on a key advantage.</p>
<p>The fact that they are women.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been said that women are more collaborative than men. It&#8217;s an asset I&#8217;ve seen pay dividends. In my years of negotiations as a corporate lawyer, I&#8217;ve observed that alpha males striding into a boardroom feel the need to put points on the board first. So begins a male pissing match. Women generally walk into negotiations with one objective – to achieve a &#8220;done deal&#8221;. This can lead to less confrontational interactions. It doesn&#8217;t make us weak; it makes us effective.</p>
<p>Women need to stop making excuses for our differences, and start making them work for us.</p>
<h3>Striding Forward in Stilettos</h3>
<p>Gender equality has come very far.</p>
<p>The fact that the colour of Hillary&#8217;s pantsuits has not hogged the headlines, and that Theresa May does not feel the need to ape male business attire, are indicators of this progress.</p>
<p>That said, women should not expect anyone to level the playing field for us. And while men should remember Michelle Obama&#8217;s words, that &#8220;the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls&#8221;, sometimes women have to take the problem in their own hands.</p>
<p>Or, to borrow someone&#8217;s memorable words and apply them to a more worthy endeavour:</p>
<p>&#8220;Grab them by the p*ssy. You can do anything&#8221;.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>On 10 May 2020, the Lianhe Zaobao published an article on the topic of volunteer support for transient workers amid the pandemic. TSMP Law Corporation head of litigation Melvin Chan was extensively quoted on the firm&#8217;s pro bono programme, which he also heads. His comments in Mandarin below: 义正律师事务所（TSMP Law Corporation）合伙人兼诉讼与解决纠纷事务主管陈家健律师（47岁）透露，事务所过去10年来平均每年为五至10起客工案件提供无偿法律咨询，每年无偿处理的客工法律案件介于三至六起，大多数是“客工亦重”“情义之家”等非营利组织引介，近四五年来以薪资或受伤索赔案居多。 他说：“事务所帮助过的不少客工，不是被迫签下另一份比原定薪资金额更少的合约，就是雇主不遵守合约条款，付给客工的薪资比列明的少。很多客工的境遇，听了让人难过。” 外籍劳工中心也透露，过去两年来每年平均有165名至300名客工因面对各种问题，到中心与新加坡律师公会无偿服务办公室联办的免费法律咨询诊所求助。 陈家健说：“我们知道的只是前来求助的案件……很明显，这不是新鲜事。我猜测每次有客工上门求助时，外面可能还有五到10起类似案例，只因事主不想惹麻烦而没被发现。如果雇主觉得客工抱怨太多，轻易就能取消工作准证，将他们送回国。” 除了无法获得应得工资的案件，义正律师事务所最近也成功协助孟加拉籍客工嘉利乐上诉，获判2万多元工伤赔偿。&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 10 May 2020, the Lianhe Zaobao published <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/znews/singapore/story20200510-1052047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article</a> on the topic of volunteer support for transient workers amid the pandemic. TSMP Law Corporation head of litigation Melvin Chan was extensively quoted on the firm&#8217;s pro bono programme, which he also heads. His comments in Mandarin below:</p>
<p>义正律师事务所（TSMP Law Corporation）合伙人兼诉讼与解决纠纷事务主管陈家健律师（47岁）透露，事务所过去10年来平均每年为五至10起客工案件提供无偿法律咨询，每年无偿处理的客工法律案件介于三至六起，大多数是“客工亦重”“情义之家”等非营利组织引介，近四五年来以薪资或受伤索赔案居多。</p>
<p>他说：“事务所帮助过的不少客工，不是被迫签下另一份比原定薪资金额更少的合约，就是雇主不遵守合约条款，付给客工的薪资比列明的少。很多客工的境遇，听了让人难过。”</p>
<p>外籍劳工中心也透露，过去两年来每年平均有165名至300名客工因面对各种问题，到中心与新加坡律师公会无偿服务办公室联办的免费法律咨询诊所求助。</p>
<p>陈家健说：“我们知道的只是前来求助的案件……很明显，这不是新鲜事。我猜测每次有客工上门求助时，外面可能还有五到10起类似案例，只因事主不想惹麻烦而没被发现。如果雇主觉得客工抱怨太多，轻易就能取消工作准证，将他们送回国。”</p>
<p>除了无法获得应得工资的案件，义正律师事务所最近也成功协助孟加拉籍客工嘉利乐上诉，获判2万多元工伤赔偿。</p>
<p>嘉利乐在一个地铁站建筑工程的地下工地工作时，不慎从两层楼高的鹰架摔下伤及背部。他被抬到地面时，身上没穿安全背带。</p>
<p>雇主事后以嘉利乐被抬出来时没穿安全背带为由，辩称他当时不可能在鹰架上工作。而嘉利乐透露，他从鹰架跌下时身上的确有穿安全背带，只是受伤被抬出来时，背带已被取下。初审时，嘉利乐提出的索赔被助理劳工总监驳回。</p>
<p>经引介，嘉利乐找上陈家健协助上诉。陈家健成功找到另一客工证实，嘉利乐确实在鹰架上工作时意外摔下。高庭法官最终驳回早前判决。</p>
<p>因为背伤留下慢性疼痛的病根，嘉利乐只好回返孟加拉当农夫，无法继续在建筑业工作。</p>
<p>谈及客工面对的挑战，陈家健说：“或许在客工的家乡，司法服务体制不是那么到位和有序，所以他们不知如何求助……也因为家乡的经历，他们没把握能透过法律途径去争取自己的权益。”</p>
<p>再来，上雇佣纠纷索偿庭（Employment Claims Tribunals）时，客工须亲自上场，无法让律师代他们说话。这其实就是一般庭讯，客工必须面对雇主，有些甚至具有法律背景，客工如果英语欠佳，往往处于劣势。</p>
<p>如何保护这群客工？陈家健建议，应鼓励客工要确保自己有银行户头，让雇主将薪水存入户头。很多领取现金薪资的客工，有时就会遇到是否领到薪水，或是否获得应得薪资的纠纷。</p>
<p>另外，雇主目前都须为每名客工支付保险按柜金（security bond）。如果客工或雇主犯法或违反工作准证条例，这笔钱就会被没收。</p>
<p>陈家健建议：“或许可考虑在合约内加入一些条款，一旦发生什么事，例如雇主没善待员工，这笔钱其实可用来赔偿员工。”</p>
<p>我国目前正实施冠病阻断措施，客工须待在宿舍，政府也一直鼓励雇主按时支付薪水。陈家健估计，近期应该不会有太多客工因被拖欠薪资而求助的情况，但阻断措施一旦解除，这类案件可能增加。</p>
<p>“阻断措施解除后，运营受疫情影响的公司可能拖欠薪资，没获得薪资的客工会开始求助。”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/launching-a-vision-to-transform-singapore-into-a-city-of-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Straits Times article published on 15 October 2019</a> wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Breaking the taboo of discussing end-of-life issues, a law firm and a community organisation worked together to help more than 120 senior citizens understand more about these matters. In July, TSMP Law Corporation and the Cassia Resettlement Team organised a party at Block 52 Cassia Crescent, where lawyers shared information with seniors on topics such as the Lasting Power of Attorney scheme, the Advance Medical Directive, and wills. The Cassia Resettlement Team is made up of volunteers who focus on helping senior residents who moved from Dakota Crescent to Cassia Crescent after the former area was slated for redevelopment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her Excellency noted that the collaboration is one example of how organisations can contribute to the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre&#8217;s (NVPC) new strategic vision of building a City of Good.</p>
<p>TSMP Law Corporation&#8217;s head of community services <a href="http://www.tsmplaw.com/lawyer/june-ho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June Ho</a> was present at the event.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been there. A woman knocking her head on the glass ceiling in a male-dominated company. A female professional who doesn’t know if she has what it takes to take the C-Suite. An aspiring lawyer who can have it all but isn’t sure what “all” is – or should be.</p>
<p>On 21 August 2019, over 50 young lawyers, legal executives and law students turned up at TSMP for the firm&#8217;s inaugural Women’s Empowerment on Speed! event, with a speed-dating style mento<span class="text_exposed_show">ring session, where 17 senior – female and male – members of the bar and the business community lend their experience and share their advice on how women can get the most out of their careers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMP Law Corporation Head of Community Services June Ho participated in a roundtable discussion published in the Business Times on 11 July 2019 on how corporates ensure that nobody is left behind in Singapore&#8217;s race towards becoming a smart city. Her responses are reproduced below:</p>
<p>THE BUSINESS TIMES: AS SINGAPORE RACES TO BECOME A SMART NATION, HOW DOES YOUR COMPANY ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND?</p>
<p>June Ho: We focus on three groups of beneficiaries that we feel are underserved: children and youth at risk, the elderly and transient workers.</p>
<p>In relation to the elderly, we recognise that the government&#8217;s drive for a cashless society &#8211; which has reached even hawker centres &#8211; has left seniors who grew up using notes and coins feeling daunted just paying for daily necessities. So last year, our Handprint Committee partnered with the Tembusu Senior Activity Centre and the South East Community Development Council to run a digital clinic outing at Kallang Wave Mall for more than 30 seniors to empower them with basic skills for navigating the digital age.</p>
<p>Our lawyers and staff taught the beneficiaries how to use e-payments, sign up for Wireless@SG, take selfies and wefies with their smartphones and communicate via WhatsApp group chats. The beneficiaries were brought on a grocery shopping trip where we taught them how to use self-checkout counters. They also enjoyed a good cup of kopi at a cafe where we showed them how to pay with the NETS Flashpay that we provided them with.</p>
<p>Also recognising that the elderly is a particularly vulnerable class in the digital age, we educated them about online and offline scams to ensure they don&#8217;t lose their hard-earned savings for fake lottery tickets or divulge personal information in &#8220;official surveys&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>This year, our Handprint projects will guide selected groups of elderly through end of life issues such as filing a lasting power of attorney and advance medical directives online.</p>
<p>THE BUSINESS TIMES: WHAT ARE THE NEW GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN EMERGING IN THE DIGITAL AGE, AND HOW IS YOUR FIRM TACKLING THE ISSUE?</p>
<p>June Ho: We recognise that in this rapidly changing economic and social landscape, the elderly are very often (and too conveniently) left behind. We at TSMP have chosen to bridge this gap through our Handprint efforts which consistently focuses on the elderly.</p>
<p>By educating them and equipping them with skills to traverse the digital landscape, we hope to provide easy-to-follow guidance in this digital age to the elderly to help them tackle issues ranging from simple daily transactions to more complicated (yet essential) end of life planning.</p>
<p>THE BUSINESS TIMES: HOW CAN CORPORATES (BIG OR SMALL) ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND IN THE DIGITAL AGE (AND TO HELP THE VULNERABLE)?</p>
<p>June Ho: We do not underestimate the potential and contributions of the Millennial generation, many of whom have life goals that extend beyond success in their careers. We have tapped into their networks to identify and reach out to segments of the community that may need a helping hand.</p>
<p>This also leads to a virtuous cycle: many of the trainees and graduates whom we recruit are attracted to work for us because of our giving DNA.</p>

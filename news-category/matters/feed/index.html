Temasek Holdings is a major shareholder of both companies. The moves are expected to strengthen both companies’ financial positions, unlock shareholder value and result in better industry focus, in order to ride out the downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic and global oil price crash, and take advantage of growth opportunities in the energy and urban sectors afterwards.</p>

<p>The TSMP team was led by Stefanie Yuen Thio and June Ho, and they were supported by Rachel Tang. IHS Markit was advised by Ashurst.</p>
<p>Catena was founded in 2002 as a fintech consultancy and transformed to become a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider of trade reporting solutions and specialises in architecture, design, and delivery of advanced technology solutions for the financial services industry. Its offerings won top awards in the Asia Risk Technology Rankings and FOW Awards for Asia.</p>
<p>Catena’s integration with IHS Markit will allow its customers will be able to enjoy a seamless, single-vendor solution that integrates transaction reporting with other post-trade and compliance workflows, enabling them to streamline their trade-reporting processes, reduce costs, and focus on strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition marks another step in the consolidation under way in the competitive regtech industry as trade reporting becomes increasingly important given the continuing changes in trade reporting requirements imposed by regulators worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMP Law Corporate dispute resolution partner Kelvin Koh commented in a Business Times <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/energy-commodities/force-majeure-is-new-abracadabra-amid-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">story</a> published on 2 March 2020 on force majeure, as energy supply chain players scramble to weigh their legal options as Chinese buyers get leery of prior purchase commitments, in the fallout from Covid-19.</p>
<p>Acting on behalf of his client, Hontop Energy (Singapore), a trading unit of China Wanda that recently went into receivership, Kelvin said that it halted its trading activities in late January on the back of &#8220;muted demand and an industrywide liquidity crunch&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hontop supplies crude oil to a refinery in Shandong province that is operated by a related company, Tianhong Chemicals. But Kelvin said that the epidemic &#8220;has heavily impacted Hontop&#8217;s China-centric oil trading business&#8221;, as the strict measures taken to contain the outbreak affected logistics and hurt demand for oil products. Tianhong expects to resume its refinery operations in early March.</p>

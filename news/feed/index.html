Temasek Holdings is a major shareholder of both companies. The moves are expected to strengthen both companies’ financial positions, unlock shareholder value and result in better industry focus, in order to ride out the downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic and global oil price crash, and take advantage of growth opportunities in the energy and urban sectors afterwards.</p>

<p>He said that even if the recent enforced experiment with remote working has resulted in no significant downside in terms of productivity for many tech firms, from the psychological perspective (both individual and organisational), there remain benefits to having a shared working space in which colleagues may physically collaborate and interact.</p>

<p>She said that if costs other than payroll expenses, such as rent, are not reduced, firms cannot survive to keep workers employed. </p>
<p>What would be ground-breaking is if the new Bill rewrites some of the terms after the contract is in force, she noted.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;That said, I think it is the right thing to do &#8211; the pandemic is unprecedented and the market cannot rely on (every) landlord to do the right thing. Whether the Bill will lead to a more lasting change to the landlord and tenant framework is a more difficult question to tackle. While you can justify having statutory restrictions on undesirable business practices, such as when terms are too onerous, I would be against a Bill that attempts to put too many limits on the ability of landlords to negotiate contract terms. This may lead to depressed real estate prices, which would have a knock-on effect on every land owner in Singapore.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMP Law Corporation&#8217;s Head of Corporate Real Estate, Jennifer Chia, was asked by the Lianhe Zaobao for her views on the Fair Tenancy Framework Industry Committee’s recommendations to solve a perceived imbalance in landlord-tenant relationship amid COVID-19 outbreak. In the <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/finance/singapore/story20200523-1055510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">story</a> published on 23 May 2020, she said she believes no bill has ever been passed from ground-up efforts. To succeed, the government must feel that there is a public interest to protect or to generate Singapore’s economic development. Singapore’s leasing practices have largely operated based on market forces and legislating the way the relationship works would hinder freedom of contract and business. Legislation dictates to landlords what they need to do – no choice about it. Once you lose control of what you can determine as an outcome, it very likely hinders your drive to innovate your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMP Law Corporation Joint Managing Partner and Head of Corporate Stefanie Yuen Thio was interviewed by Asia Business Law Journal for a 20 May 2020 piece on challenges women face in the legal profession, which was sparked by a study by the World Bank titled &#8220;Women, Business and the Law 2020”.</p>
<p>She said: “COVID-19 has forced almost everyone, all over the world, to work from home. Both parents now have direct and very immediate experience of the mayhem that is bringing up a family. The virus can be a great leveller in the household by forcing couples to divide their responsibilities, and to understand the other person’s struggles.”</p>
<p>Yuen Thio adds that another issue women face is the expectations others have of them. “What’s been the real challenge are the unspoken expectations,” she says. “You have to be every inch a professional, and very much a lady. Stand up to your male counterpart, but don’t lose your femininity. You must be able to carry as many documents as they can, and walk as fast; but you must do it in 3-inch heels and a smart pencil-skirt suit, because that’s how women project professional credibility.”</p>

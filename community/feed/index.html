										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The excellent care provided for the poor and destitute elderly at St Theresa’s Home was first highlighted to TSMP through its internal community network. TSMP also recognised that the Home is a very worthy charity that is under-funded. Additionally, many of the older generation folks in the Home, who may feel lonely in their silver years, yearn to partake in festivities during the holiday season. For these reasons, TSMP partnered with the Home to design a program that addressed a real need in the community at this time of year.</p>
<p>As part of a strategic charity initiative under TSMP’s Handprint community outreach programme, about 40 lawyers and employees from the firm turned on their out-of-office email notices to join forces with the staff from the Home to create for the residents a Christmas to remember.</p>
<p>A particularly well-received activity at the event was the “Passing the Parcel” game, a static musical-chair game of sorts designed for gifting. A bundle of 10 gifts wrapped up in successive layers of bright wrapping paper was passed around by the residents while Christmas-themed music was being played. The delighted resident holding on to the bundle when the music stopped got to unwrap the bundle and keep the gift in that layer. The game repeated until the “top prize” at the core of the parcel was claimed to much applause.</p>
<p>For a more hands-on activity, TSMP staff collaborated with the residents in creating festive-themed art using strings and pegs. This provided a chance for deeper interaction with the elderly, and in fact proved more challenging for some of the artistically challenged TSMPers than the seniors they were supposed to help! For the 150 bed-bound residents unable to join the activities, TSMP staff visited them at their wards to talk to them, hear their stories and give out goodie bags just to share some good cheer.</p>
<p>The wonderful morning wrapped up with a buffet lunch with a live noodle cooking station and a sing-along session where Christmas carols and other old favourites in multiple languages such as Silent Night, Feliz Navidad, 月亮代表我的心 and Take Me Home, Country Roads drew out hitherto reticent crooners in full force and voice.</p>
<p>“It is heartwarming indeed to see the elderly at St Theresa’s Home celebrate life so joyously during this festive season, and we are honoured to have had enjoyed the company of the lovely residents who took time to share with us a wealth of stories and life lessons as well,” said TSMP partner Ian Lim, who oversees the firm’s Community Programmes. “There is a great deal we can and should learn from our seniors who have literally seen it all.”</p>
<p>TSMP lawyers and staff planned and organised the event, providing materials, gifts, goodie bags and handling lunch and logistics. As part of its outreach programme, TSMP organises and participates in two community charity events a year under its Handprint series, aiming to benefit at-risk children and youth, foreign workers and the elderly.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, TSMP ran a digital clinic outing at Kallang Wave Mall for 34 seniors from the Tembusu Senior Activity Centre to equip them for the digital age. Previously, it partnered with Tasek Jurong Limited to organise an educational and fun-filled “Amazing Race”-style trail around Singapore’s Civic District to bring joy to some 50 socially disadvantaged children and youth and acquaint them with Singapore’s cultural and historical heritage.</p>
<p>Under the umbrella organisation of Catholic Welfare Services, St Theresa’s Home is a nursing home built on a foundation of Christian values of love and care for others, especially for those less fortunate in our society. It aims to create a cheery and familial home for the elderly and aged sick, a place where they can live out their golden years or recuperate sufficiently from their illnesses to be able to return to their loved ones. St Theresa’s Home is licensed by the Ministry of Health, Singapore with a capacity for 200 residents. Most of its residents are discharged from re-structured hospitals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading Singapore boutique law firm TSMP Law Corporation ran a digital clinic outing at Kallang Wave Mall for 34 seniors on 9 November 2018 to equip them for the digital age. The firm partnered with Tembusu Senior Activity Centre (SAC) and South East Community Development Council (CDC) for the event, a strategic charity initiative under TSMP’s Handprint community outreach programme.</p>
<p>With the government’s drive for a cashless society reaching even hawker centres, seniors who grew up using notes and coins may feel daunted by the new technology being implemented. At the same time, news reports of scammers conning the elderly – some losing their entire life savings – are on the rise, both online and offline.</p>
<p>The event aimed to empower seniors by providing them with the skills to confidently navigate an increasingly digital world. 40 staff from TSMP, accompanied by two staff from Tembusu SAC, taught the beneficiaries how to use e-payments, sign up for Wireless@SG, take selfies and wefies with their smartphones and communicate via WhatsApp chat groups.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the perils of modern scams, some TSMPers also took on roles as “conmen”, approaching the unsuspecting seniors while they shopped to persuade them to part with their money in exchange for fake lottery tickets, or divulge their personal details in “official surveys”.</p>
<p>The day began with the elders enjoying a meal at Tembusu SAC, after which they were brought to Kallang Wave Mall. There, with the help of TSMPers, they shopped at the NTUC Fairprice Xtra supermarket using the self-checkout counters, and bought tea and coffee for themselves at the cafes, all while using NETS Flashpay cards that they had been provided with. They also enjoyed electronic games at an arcade before heading back to Tembusu SAC and home with goodie bags.</p>
<p>“As technology marches relentlessly on, people who do not keep abreast of developments run the risk of becoming disconnected from the community around them as well as falling victim to the increasing number of sophisticated online and phone scams. One of the most vulnerable groups is the elderly,” said TSMP partner Ian Lim, who oversees the firm’s Community Programmes.</p>
<p>“We tried to teach the seniors at the Tembusu SAC a little of this, and found ourselves getting schooled in Rummikub and at the arcade at the same time! We’re grateful to Tembusu SAC and South East CDC for giving us an opportunity to interact with the delightful seniors of the Centre in this meaningful way.”</p>
<p>In preparing for this event, TSMP had previously conducted a preliminary get-to-know-you gathering at the Tembusu SAC earlier in the year to understand the seniors’ needs to better tailor the programme for the day to their level of competency.</p>
<p>TSMP lawyers and staff planned and organised the event, providing NETS Flashpay cards and goodie bags, leading groups and handling food and logistics. As part of its outreach programme, TSMP organises and participates in two community charity events a year under its Handprint series, aiming to benefit at-risk children and youth, foreign workers and the elderly.</p>
<p>Tembusu SAC is a community-based elder care facility which serves elderly folks from rental flats, studio units and purchased flats in the Eunos area.  Recognising the South East CDC’s capabilities for social outreach, TSMP tapped into its community network to identify a senior beneficiary group to partner with. As a result, TSMP was able to design a program which addressed a genuine need in the community and directly plugged an existing gap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMP had two reasons to celebrate: its 10th anniversary, and raising $120,000 for the Singapore chapter of Operation Smile. In a charity dinner event commemorating the milestone, guests tucked into a meal prepared by Chef Willin Low while enjoying live entertainment by Broadway Beng star Sebastian Tan, all while being served by TSMP lawyers who worked the evening as waitstaff and bartenders. Operation Smile is a worldwide children’s medical charity dedicated to providing free, quality surgery for needy kids with correctable facial deformities, who otherwise would not have access to these life-saving procedures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMP lawyers and staff brought back memories of the Mid-Autumn Festival to the residents of St John’s Home for Elderly Persons with mooncakes, lanterns, food, games and songs. Many elderly persons yearn for company during festivals and holidays. St John’s Home for Elderly Persons provides shelter and care for the elderly — many of whom are on public assistance. In Mid-Autumn Night’s Dream, we wanted to give them a night to remember by re-creating a food street serving up local favourites from yesteryear, but their warmth, laughter and spirit made this a truly memorable Mid-Autumn Festival for all of us instead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 8 September 2017, TSMP Law Corporation and Tasek Jurong Limited organised an educational and fun-filled heritage trail around Singapore’s Civic District to bring joy to some 50+ socially disadvantaged children and youth, and acquaint them with Singapore’s cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The event, flagged off by Guest of Honour Rahayu Mahzam, Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC, saw participants race against the clock to complete the circuit, which started at the Cavenagh Bridge and included stops at notable historical and cultural landmarks and monuments like the Cenotaph, Lim Bo Seng Memorial, Victoria Concert Hall and Fort Canning Park.</p>
<p>At each station, they took part in activities old and new in keeping with the theme, ranging from a chapteh (“kick feather shuttlecock”) contest to a fidget spinner challenge, which they had to complete before being given clues leading them to the next stop. They were also taught the significance of each site by the station masters, sparking their interest in Singapore’s history.</p>
<p>TSMP closed the firm for a day for all its employees to take part in the event, with staff manning stations, leading groups and handling games, food and logistics. As part of its outreach programme, TSMP organises and participates in two community charity events a year under its Handprint series, aiming to benefit at-risk children and youth, foreign workers and the elderly. Last year, it partnered with HOME and TWC2 to bring migrant workers to RWS SEA Aquarium to celebrate the contributions of our foreign friends in building our nation. It also organised a MasterChef Junior showdown at CulinaryOn Singapore, where professional chefs imparted cooking skills to boys from the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home.</p>
<p>“In fast-paced, upwardly mobile Singapore, it’s easy to forget those who fall through the cracks, often through no fault of their own,” says TSMP partner Ian Lim, who oversees its Community Programmes. “Tasek Jurong makes it their mission to nurture and develop these underprivileged<br />
youth at risk, and we ended up being the privileged ones when we got to partner Tasek and enjoy the kids’ company while running around town locating and learning more about Singapore’s cultural heritage landmarks together.”</p>
<p>Tasek Jurong Limited, a non-profit organisation, dedicates itself to support and help uplift its beneficiaries – the socially disadvantaged – who include ex-inmates, youth at risk, single parents, the needy and disabled and their families, among others.</p>
<p>“When we mentioned ‘Amazing Race in the City’, Tasek Jurong children were excited and looked forward to the event,” says Tasek Jurong CEO Muhammad Faizal. “Through this activity, they learnt about hard work and teamwork, which are important values in order for them to grow together. We are grateful to TSMP for partnering with us in this activity, as a way of giving back and helping to nurture a caring society.”</p>

Along with our pro bono work for HOME and TWC2, this was a tangible way of giving back a little something to these tireless integral members of our society who contribute so much to our family (and by extension, professional) lives, often at considerable personal sacrifice. The foreign domestic workers themselves put up a great show for us through their performance items, reminding us that we often receive more than we give at our charity events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">TSMP Law Corporation is taking Mid-Autumn Festival one step further this year &#8211; come 21 September, the firm will be cooking up a storm of mooncakes with 70 seniors from the AWWA Senior Community Home at the Prima Baking Industry Training College.</p>
<p class="p2">TSMP will close the firm for a day on 21 September for all 120 of its employees to be involved, with a TSMP volunteer pairing up each AWWA senior to make snowskin mooncakes together. To add to the festive spirit, the seniors will then be treated to a sumptuous lunch at the Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant, and a lively afternoon of Bingo and lucky draw. In addition, as several members of the AWWA Home face health and mobility issues and will be unable to join the mooncake making, a second TSMP team will visit the AWWA Senior Community Home that morning to distribute goodie-bags and mooncakes, and just share good cheer with the seniors.</p>
<p class="p2">The AWWA Health and Senior Care arm was established in 1976 and provides dedicated services to cater to the special needs of the elderly. Under it, the AWWA Senior Community Home provides accommodation for older Singaporeans over the age of 60 who have been referred to the Home from hospitals, are on public assistance or have no means of financial support. The Home currently cares for 135 seniors, many of whom no longer have family members. Senior residents at the Home occupy three floors of a block of rental flats in Ang Mo Kio, and with the AWWA Senior Activity Centre at its void deck, an inspiring sense of community and family has developed, with the senior residents enabled to live amongst friends with independence and dignity. As a wonderful testament to the Home’s success in building bonds, two elderly couples have actually met and fallen in love while staying there, with one couple getting married at the KFC just across the road!</p>
<p class="p2">Says Tim Oei, CEO of AWWA <i>“Mid-Autumn is a festival that symbolises the joy of having family around us, and having TSMP volunteers around our seniors at this time of the festivities means a lot to them. We thank TSMP and their staff for spending this occasion with them.” </i></p>
<p class="p2">TSMP organises and holds two community charity events each year, closing the firm for the day so that all its employees can be fully involved. Last year, TSMP organised outdoor laser tag for 50 boys from the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home and organised a clothes donation drive for the boys and their families, amassing 25 boxes of clothes, shoes, stationery and games. TSMP previously also brought foreign construction workers for a day out at the Singapore Zoo, and had celebrity chef cooking classes at ToTT for Down’s syndrome children.</p>
<p class="p2">“This event will be the largest community event we’ve ever organised,” says TSMP Director Ian Lim, who oversees its Community Programmes. “AWWA’s aim of empowering the disadvantaged to lead dignified and independent lives really resonates with us, and we couldn’t be happier that this Golden Jubilee year for Singapore, we can spend time like this with these wonderful seniors in their golden years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE call came from a law firm, and home-grown celebrity chefs Willin Low and Janice Wong jumped at the chance to dish out cooking lessons yesterday.</p>
<p>Their students were 36 youngsters from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore&#8217;s (Minds) Lee Kong Chian Gardens School (LGS). Each chef taught a specially tailored class, aiming to impart simple culinary skills in a fun way.</p>
<p>The first 18 students, together with their teachers and volunteers from TSMP Law Corporation, checked into the Tools Of The Trade cooking studio in Dunearn Road as early as 9am</p>
<p>Ms Wong, 27, took the morning session. On the teaching menu was simple fare such as chocolate cupcakes and cheese pasta.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have worked with many charities, and it is encouraging to see children, despite their special situation, so enthusiastic to learn new skills,&#8217; said the dessert chef, who was trained at world-renowned culinary school Le Cordon Bleu Paris. She opened a restaurant called the 2am:dessertbar 21/2 years ago.</p>
<p>Mr Low, 39, a lawyer-turned-chef, said his Wild Rocket Group believes in &#8216;giving back to society&#8217;, and this year it picked children. &#8216;We have been giving to The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, and when TSMP asked us to do this, we jumped at the opportunity,&#8217; he added.</p>
<p>He took the second batch at 1.30pm, teaching the students how to make salad, curry mayo chicken sandwiches, kaya bread and butter pudding.</p>
<p>Getting his gloved fingers dirty with egg and chocolate was 18-year-old Poh Chian An.</p>
<p>The Minds student, who loved the experience, was recently awarded a training stint in room service with the Holiday Inn Singapore, and said he is looking forward to the experience.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s cooking classes were part of TSMP&#8217;s continuing community programme.</p>
<p>Its joint managing director, Mr Thio Shen Yi, 44, said his firm had an insight into what life was like for special needs children last year. &#8216;We took some children with autism and cerebral palsy to Universal Studios then. It was uplifting and humbling at the same time, and we wanted to take this opportunity to work with these children again,&#8217; he added.</p>
<p>Ms Vijaya Rajagopal, 55, a pre-vocation teacher at LGS, said such programmes are a good way of integrating children with special needs into society.</p>
<p>&#8216;These children are no different from other children. More of such sessions will help people to understand and accept them. Perhaps they would be able to find employment in the future,&#8217; she added.</p>
<p>LGS, one of Minds&#8217; 11 special education schools, offers a broad-spectrum curriculum to teach, equip and train its 247 intellectually disabled students for a productive future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">TSMP Law Corporation spends a day out with boys from Muhammadiyah Welfare Home playing outdoor obstacle course.</p>
<p class="p2">Muhammadiyah Welfare Home is an all-boys home which has since 1989 provided care and shelter for Muslim boys aged 10 to 19 years old. It currently has over 70 boys under its care. Some of its boys are orphans or have been victims of abuse and neglect from a young age, others are from disadvantaged families, while yet others have been through the juvenile court system. Muhammadiyah Welfare Home is dedicated to guiding, nurturing, rehabilitating and empowering these boys towards becoming responsible and contributing members of their families and communities.</p>
<p class="p2">TSMP organises and holds two community charity events each year, closing the firm for the day so that all its employees can be fully involved. Some events from previous years include bringing wheelchair bound residents from Man Fut Tong Nursing Home to the Resorts World Marine Life Park SEA Aquarium, giving foreign workers a day out at the Singapore Zoo, and having celebrity chef cooking classes at ToTT for Down’s syndrome children. This year, the firm went even further to benefit the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home by organising a clothes donation drive with other firms for the boys and their families. In just two weeks, TSMP amassed 25 boxes of clothes, shoes, stationery and games for the boys, including a Sony PlayStation which the boys were delighted to add to the Home&#8217;s recreation room.</p>
<p class="p2">Says Mdm Rahmatunnisa bte Abdul Majeed, Superintendent of Muhammadiyah Welfare Home, &#8220;It is so meaningful what TSMP is organising for our boys. It helps us give the boys an opportunity to build their self-esteem and learn teamwork, while enjoying an activity entirely new to most of them. Equally important was the clothes donation drive, which will really be useful to the boys and their families as we all work together to rebuild their broken lives and shattered dreams.&#8221;</p>
